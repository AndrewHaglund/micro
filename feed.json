				"title": "The State of UI Design in 2025",
				"content_html": "<p>The new design of iOS and macOS 26 this summer has been controversial to say the least. To my eyes the glass effects do, in fact, look cool. But many aspects of the design make no logical sense. Apple‚Äôs obsession with ‚Äúgetting the UI out of the way of your content‚Äù is absurd and when you look at how they <em>executed</em> on this idea, it‚Äôs clear they didn‚Äôt achieve that goal: The new UI is more distracting, less predictable, less stable, and less readable than ever before.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve been using Apple‚Äôs new design language on my iPad and Mac, following the discourse and reception to it, and it has me thinking about the design industry as a whole. Apple‚Äôs reputation looms large in the design world. Many designers look up to Apple. We look to them for guidance to define what it means to make ‚Äúa good app.‚Äù My concern at the moment: if Apple has lost its way, will the world of design blindly follow, or will they think critically and assess if Apple‚Äôs vision and direction is any good?</p>\n<p>There is certainly a level of craft and quality achieved within Liquid Glass, some (but <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@marcoarment/114927268189889547\">not all</a>) of the transitions and effects are kind of mesmerizing. Underlying this layer of unusable glass is seemingly <em>nothing</em>. There used to be a solid foundation of human-computer interaction principles that <em>sat beneath</em> the visual quality of the design from Apple. In fact, they were trailblazers and founding-members of this discipline. The Apple designers of the past understood the importance of contrast, differentiating controls, and studying how users thought and felt about their interfaces by studying their behavior. It‚Äôs clear that this approach to design is no longer in power at Apple.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I consider <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2025/07/31/ep-428\">Episode 428 of <em>The Talk Show</em></a> to be required listening if you design or build software. There are too many quotes to pull from but trust me, just listen to all (3 hours) of it. <a href=\"https://lmnt.me/\">Louie Mantia</a> is the guest and I have the utmost admiration and respect for his taste and <a href=\"https://parakeet.co/\">work</a>. His recent blog post, <a href=\"https://lmnt.me/blog/a-responsibility-to-the-industry.html\">A Responsibility to the Industry</a>, covers many of the same points I‚Äôm making here. It was this post (and others) that sparked John Gruber to invite Louie onto the show.</p>\n<p>The conversation revolves around the new operating systems featuring Liquid Glass. One thing that struck me is how design has shifted over time to say <em>UX</em> (or user experience) as opposed to <em>UI</em> (or user interface). This episode talks about the ‚Äúhow it works‚Äù of software design but it also covers a ton about how it ‚Äúlooks and feels‚Äù. You could argue Apple‚Äôs new design language over-prioritizes ‚Äúlooks and feel‚Äù and leaves behind the ‚Äúhow it works.‚Äù</p>\n<p>In 2025 I feel too much of the design industry has lost the attention to detail and focus on the ‚Äúlook and feel‚Äù of software. Over the past 10-15 years UX practitioners have had to beg and claw to get a seat at the table at companies. We‚Äôve had to prove and argue what a good experience is worth. This absolutely helped grow our industry and bring design thinking into many more organizations.</p>\n<p>As part of this transition to power, however, we‚Äôve too often cozied-up to the ‚Äúsuits‚Äù to ensure we‚Äôre delivering <em>value</em> and we‚Äôve pitched ourselves as ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not <em>just</em> UI designers, we think about the entire user experience‚Äù. While this sounds good, the issue is that it implies that making nice interfaces is <strong>not valuable</strong> in-and-of itself. This is false! Think of <em>slide to unlock</em> from the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKMoT-6XSg\">original iPhone</a> debut. Here&rsquo;s Louie around 2 hr 14 min:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The first interaction we had with iPhone was slide to unlock. [Jobs] did it twice because everyone was <em>so</em> into it. There is an important part of making things make sense, making them joyful. There‚Äôs delightful thing because if you don&rsquo;t have that, then the entire system looks like something you don&rsquo;t want to¬†touch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course software needs to solve a problem. I think Tony Fadell captures this well with his <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/graham-winfrey/nest-tony-fadell-on-bringing-innovation-to-market.html\">‚Äúmake painkillers, not vitamins‚Äù</a> quip, but we‚Äôve lost a lot of <strong>craft and appreciation</strong> for making great interfaces that work well and feel amazing.</p>\n<p>It needs to be both. We need to help solve customer problems <strong>and</strong> we need to make the interactions wonderful. We‚Äôve <em>discredited</em> and <em>downplayed</em> visual design but that‚Äôs the actual thing customers touch and click! In the name of getting a seat at the table we threw away the art of making apps look and feel <strong>great</strong>.</p>\n<p>There must be a better balance.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I‚Äôve pulled a few quotes from <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2025/07/31/ep-428\">the episode</a>. Here‚Äôs around 1 hr 50 min:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>John Gruber: I had a friend who, recently-ish, ex-Apple, he had been there doing design work for 15 plus 20 years? I don&rsquo;t know, but he left somewhat recently, and he watched [<a href=\"https://youtu.be/dHrVGk0WwYM?t=381\">the Aqua introduction video</a>]‚Ä¶ and said, ‚ÄúI forgot that Steve talked like that about using UI design lingo, like <em>key window</em> and <em>input focus</em> and things like that.‚Äù He said to me that he had meetings with Alan Dye&rsquo;s team in recent-ish years and that he‚Äôd used terms like that. And he said, ‚ÄúI never got cut off, but there was always an underlying tone of <em>shut up with the UI nerd stuff</em>.‚Äù That they didn&rsquo;t use terms like that, and that when describing an idea, that their eyes would roll back in their head, ‚ÄúHere goes another one of these key-window input-focus guys again.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, they‚Äôre the fucking team that shipped an iPad multi-window interface for 7 years where you couldn&rsquo;t tell which half of the screen was active.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Louie Mantia: You and I have talked about this before, this exact thing like years ago, but we <strong>solved that problem</strong> like over a decade ago. Why are we doing this right now where we are backtracking on the things that we already know to be true? I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t really make any sense to me why it‚Äôs hard to distinguish the inactive window.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There‚Äôs <em>so much</em> in this episode. This snippet in particular highlights that there‚Äôs a disdain for making interfaces usable within Apple. I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs even their third or fifth priority. I worry it‚Äôs <em>not even on their list</em>.</p>\n<p>John Gruber also had the opportunity to ask Alan Dye years ago about how Apple Watch handled overlapping hour, minute, and second hands on analog watch faces:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every physical watch with analog hands, the hands are stacked in the same order: where the hour hand is on the bottom, the minute hand is on top of the hour hand, and if there&rsquo;s a second hand, it&rsquo;s on top of the minute hand so that the hours, minutes, seconds are going forward.</p>\n<p>An Apple Watch renders the hands in the same Z-axis order. It‚Äôs not perfectly flat. And they render a sort of shadow around things so that you could see like when the minute hand is slightly overlapping‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>I had a question about the light source for the shadow, and I was like, <em>oh finally</em>, I get to ask Alan Dye about this.</p>\n<p>And he was like, ‚ÄúOh, we render a shadow?‚Äù</p>\n<p>I just instantly realized: you‚Äôd never really even looked at it that closely. Like <em>somebody</em> at Apple has, but Alan Dye didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I just remember thinking at that very moment, it just suddenly came to me, ‚Äúoh, he doesn&rsquo;t do what I thought he did.‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Related, a bit later (around the 2 hr 31 min mark) from Louie:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Steve] had a level of familiarity with [details]. I don&rsquo;t just know this because <em>my team</em> worked on it. I know it because I use it every day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At first blush, it may seem unfair to criticize a VP at a multi-trillion-dollar corporation with this sort of minutia. But this is the <em>watch face</em> of the Apple Watch. (It‚Äôs not some <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@siracusa/114898428763571700\">obscure macOS system settings screen</a> where the default system colors have now changed and now it‚Äôs impossible to distinguish which item is selected.) As someone who uses an Apple Watch <strong>I</strong> have personally seen this shadow. Once or twice in the 10 years of wearing this dang computer on my wrist I‚Äôve looked down at my wrist and it‚Äôs been 1:05, 2:10 or 3:15, and so on. If you have an Apple Watch, you, (yes, even you dear reader!) probably have seen this shadow too.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs like Alan Dye has never used the computers his teams are responsible for designing.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There‚Äôs a great segment about John‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbrfsXYoyCI&amp;pp=ygUUYXV0ZWFyIGRlaXNnbiBncnViZXI%3D\">Auteur Theory of Design</a> where he talks about how authorship differs between books (Mark Twain‚Äôs <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>), film (Steven Spielberg‚Äôs <em>Jaws</em>), and software (an app, and operating system, etc) as the number of people involved increases:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>John Gruber: My conclusion was that the level of quality of the work of a company, whether it‚Äôs hardware or software or something in between, eventually rises or falls to the level of taste of the person who‚Äôs <em>ultimately in charge</em> of it and gets to say yes or no. And I think we‚Äôre seeing Apple&rsquo;s UI design, not the styling, which is a separate issue, but the quality of the semantic design of the user interface, sort of fall apart because like you said, I don&rsquo;t know that there is person. It‚Äôs like trying to make a movie without a director.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Louie Mantia: I think all of these people can collectively say, ‚Äúthis is their app‚Äù, or ‚Äúthis is their OS that they worked on,‚Äù that they are the author. I think everyone who works on this stuff is entitled to say that they made it ‚Äî unequivocally. But there has to be this person and that <strong>everyone‚Äôs meeting that vision</strong>. And I&rsquo;ve used the word ‚Äúvision‚Äù to describe this thing like directorial stuff. There is someone&rsquo;s vision that they have and when it meets that, that‚Äôs when we‚Äôre shipping.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>There‚Äôs a great analogy of a costume designer for a Wes Anderson movie. That person (likely) doesn‚Äôt dress like a Wes Anderson character every day in real life. But when they to work on a Wes Anderson movie, they know what‚Äôs <em>expected of them</em> and they rise to that bar and adjust their taste. They know the assignment.</p>\n<p>From Louie Mantia, around 2 hr 32 min:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My question that I‚Äôve had is, why does [Alan Dye] have this job? Why is he the person that does it?</p>\n<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t think Wes Anderson makes the best movies, I think we have to agree, he is the definition of that auteur ‚Äî one-million percent that kind of person ‚Äî so you have this clear vision and everyone is in service of that. You see it in the people that are the cinematographers, you see it in the people that are the actors that he chooses, everyone there is fully committed to the vision and I think that was true when Steve was there.</p>\n<p>Everyone, and I‚Äôve talked with friends at Apple that have been there, that used to work there, people I used to work with, everyone agrees about this: Everyone was happy to let go of their own personal idea of how things should be in service of the <strong>vision</strong> that Steve generally had. Yes we were still making all these individual decisions. Yes we were still deciding how, but we were all in the back of our minds, ‚Äúlike what is the thing that we are guiding towards?‚Äù and it was always toward the vision that Steve.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When I rejoined John¬†Deere a couple years ago we were going through a transformation (following the <a href=\"https://www.svpg.com/\">Silicon Valley Product Group</a> model). We had someone whose title literally has ‚Äúdirector‚Äù in it who started establishing large reviews for upcoming features with a few goals: increase awareness across the organization, break down silo walls, improve collaboration, and raise the quality bar. This person would attend these reviews and provide honest (and fair!) feedback. Quite often their critique was not that the designs ‚Äúweren‚Äôt good‚Äù, but that the team hadn‚Äôt considered all the various parts of our ecosystem and failed to loop-in teams should have been looped-in.</p>\n<p>This person‚Äôs goal was to <strong>elevate the quality</strong> of the entire organization. This level of scrutiny and attention to detail meant that everyone started <em>thinking differently</em>. We all started thinking, ‚Äúwe better do a good job on this and think end-to-end because we know we‚Äôll get that feedback from you-know-who.‚Äù Over the years I‚Äôve noticed this director‚Äôs presence a bit less in these reviews (except for big things) but the process and practice changes have remained. We know that this person <em>could</em> show up and we all strive to do better work because of it.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs what I think about when I hear about Gruber and Louie talk about <strong>vision</strong> and improving quality. We have to aspire and reach to make things of high quality. It doesn‚Äôt happen just by hiring talented people, you have to push a bit.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Around 2 hr 40 min:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Gruber:</em> [Talking about Aqua] The language of that era of Apple design encompassed that range that Steve Jobs set out to cover from novice to pro.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Louie:</em> The style of Aqua was so adaptable and that‚Äôs what made it work. Those productivity tools (Final Cut, Logic) didn‚Äôt ignore Aqua. They acknowledged Aqua. They understood what it was trying to do. They adapted it to their product. Aperture was entirely graphic, right? Even GarageBand was super playful, right? GarageBand had wood on the side of the thing but it took away almost no screen real estate‚Ä¶ but it puts you in a mood. It puts a visual clarity on what <em>this</em> app is versus what this <em>other</em> app is. At no point did it look like it was not part of the same system. There was a <strong>visual richness</strong> to Aqua that was like: so the system looks like <em>this</em>. Even if we have buttons that are rich Corinthian leather, even if we have buttons that are wood, right? Even if we have these other materials, they need to match this level of quality, of this visual quality that [Aqua] has.</p>\n<p>Everyone is working on this movie, right? Everyone sees what the direction is and everyone‚Äôs like, okay, so in the ‚ÄúAqua Cinematic Universe‚Äù, there&rsquo;s actually more room for it than just Aqua, right? And that was true on iOS too. Early iOS stuff, when it was iPhoneOS: iPhone OS had all of these different kinds of material qualities to it where any app could do whatever we wanted, especially because it was taking up the full screen at the time. You could do anything and it was <em>not</em> incongruous with the system. As long as you acknowledged what the system was trying to do, then you could play with a little bit.</p>\n<p>Can you do that with Liquid Glass? Because it feels to me that if it doesn‚Äôt look like Liquid Glass, then it looks wrong on the platform, right? There&rsquo;s no alternative quality. There‚Äôs no alternative material to use. It‚Äôs not like you can suddenly use paper, but make it looks like it belongs in the ‚ÄúLiquid Glass Cinematic Universe.‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Gruber:</em> And that‚Äôs why I&rsquo;m so disappointed overall with the big new UI [redesign]. We didn&rsquo;t even know what it was supposed to look like, but there were rumors for the last year that Apple‚Äôs doing a big platforms-spanning UI redesign and that it‚Äôs going to add some kind of texture and glass and something. I was so hopeful that it would bring back some of that era. Some of that tactical quality, some of that richness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There‚Äôs a lot to unpack here and I just loved this segment.</p>\n<p>After some time with macOS Tahoe, I find myself getting lost at glance in a sea of sameness. As an industry we‚Äôve been chasing down <em>consistency</em> and <em>design systems</em> for basically forever. Familiarity has amazing qualities. It means you can learn one piece of software and have that translate across the system. (For example: once you learn system features like the macOS menu bar or <em>Customize Toolbar</em>, all your apps open up to you. To borrow an old Cocoa/AppKit analogy: you‚Äôre starting on the third floor instead of the basement.)</p>\n<p>This <em>sea of sameness</em> across macOS presents itself: every window is expanse of white with glass buttons (with terrible toolbar gradient shadows).

				"content_text": "The new design of iOS and macOS 26 this summer has been controversial to say the least. To my eyes the glass effects do, in fact, look cool. But many aspects of the design make no logical sense. Apple‚Äôs obsession with ‚Äúgetting the UI out of the way of your content‚Äù is absurd and when you look at how they *executed* on this idea, it‚Äôs clear they didn‚Äôt achieve that goal: The new UI is more distracting, less predictable, less stable, and less readable than ever before.\n\nI‚Äôve been using Apple‚Äôs new design language on my iPad and Mac, following the discourse and reception to it, and it has me thinking about the design industry as a whole. Apple‚Äôs reputation looms large in the design world. Many designers look up to Apple. We look to them for guidance to define what it means to make ‚Äúa good app.‚Äù My concern at the moment: if Apple has lost its way, will the world of design blindly follow, or will they think critically and assess if Apple‚Äôs vision and direction is any good?\n\nThere is certainly a level of craft and quality achieved within Liquid Glass, some (but [not all](https://mastodon.social/@marcoarment/114927268189889547)) of the transitions and effects are kind of mesmerizing. Underlying this layer of unusable glass is seemingly *nothing*. There used to be a solid foundation of human-computer interaction principles that *sat beneath* the visual quality of the design from Apple. In fact, they were trailblazers and founding-members of this discipline. The Apple designers of the past understood the importance of contrast, differentiating controls, and studying how users thought and felt about their interfaces by studying their behavior. It‚Äôs clear that this approach to design is no longer in power at Apple. \n\n---\n\nI consider [Episode 428 of *The Talk Show*](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2025/07/31/ep-428) to be required listening if you design or build software. There are too many quotes to pull from but trust me, just listen to all (3 hours) of it. [Louie Mantia](https://lmnt.me/) is the guest and I have the utmost admiration and respect for his taste and [work](https://parakeet.co/). His recent blog post, [A Responsibility to the Industry](https://lmnt.me/blog/a-responsibility-to-the-industry.html), covers many of the same points I‚Äôm making here. It was this post (and others) that sparked John Gruber to invite Louie onto the show.\n\nThe conversation revolves around the new operating systems featuring Liquid Glass. One thing that struck me is how design has shifted over time to say *UX* (or user experience) as opposed to *UI* (or user interface). This episode talks about the ‚Äúhow it works‚Äù of software design but it also covers a ton about how it ‚Äúlooks and feels‚Äù. You could argue Apple‚Äôs new design language over-prioritizes ‚Äúlooks and feel‚Äù and leaves behind the ‚Äúhow it works.‚Äù\n\nIn 2025 I feel too much of the design industry has lost the attention to detail and focus on the ‚Äúlook and feel‚Äù of software. Over the past 10-15 years UX practitioners have had to beg and claw to get a seat at the table at companies. We‚Äôve had to prove and argue what a good experience is worth. This absolutely helped grow our industry and bring design thinking into many more organizations.\n\nAs part of this transition to power, however, we‚Äôve too often cozied-up to the ‚Äúsuits‚Äù to ensure we‚Äôre delivering *value* and we‚Äôve pitched ourselves as ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not *just* UI designers, we think about the entire user experience‚Äù. While this sounds good, the issue is that it implies that making nice interfaces is **not valuable** in-and-of itself. This is false! Think of _slide to unlock_ from the [original iPhone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKMoT-6XSg) debut. Here's Louie around 2 hr 14 min:\n\n> The first interaction we had with iPhone was slide to unlock. [Jobs] did it twice because everyone was *so* into it. There is an important part of making things make sense, making them joyful. There‚Äôs delightful thing because if you don't have that, then the entire system looks like something you don't want to¬†touch.\n\nOf course software needs to solve a problem. I think Tony Fadell captures this well with his [‚Äúmake painkillers, not vitamins‚Äù](https://www.inc.com/graham-winfrey/nest-tony-fadell-on-bringing-innovation-to-market.html) quip, but we‚Äôve lost a lot of **craft and appreciation** for making great interfaces that work well and feel amazing.\n\nIt needs to be both. We need to help solve customer problems **and** we need to make the interactions wonderful. We‚Äôve *discredited* and *downplayed* visual design but that‚Äôs the actual thing customers touch and click! In the name of getting a seat at the table we threw away the art of making apps look and feel **great**.\n\nThere must be a better balance.\n\n---\n\nI‚Äôve pulled a few quotes from [the episode](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2025/07/31/ep-428). Here‚Äôs around 1 hr 50 min:\n\n> John Gruber: I had a friend who, recently-ish, ex-Apple, he had been there doing design work for 15 plus 20 years? I don't know, but he left somewhat recently, and he watched [[the Aqua introduction video](https://youtu.be/dHrVGk0WwYM?t=381)]‚Ä¶ and said, ‚ÄúI forgot that Steve talked like that about using UI design lingo, like *key window* and *input focus* and things like that.‚Äù He said to me that he had meetings with Alan Dye's team in recent-ish years and that he‚Äôd used terms like that. And he said, ‚ÄúI never got cut off, but there was always an underlying tone of *shut up with the UI nerd stuff*.‚Äù That they didn't use terms like that, and that when describing an idea, that their eyes would roll back in their head, ‚ÄúHere goes another one of these key-window input-focus guys again.‚Äù\n> \n> Meanwhile, they‚Äôre the fucking team that shipped an iPad multi-window interface for 7 years where you couldn't tell which half of the screen was active.\n\n> Louie Mantia: You and I have talked about this before, this exact thing like years ago, but we **solved that problem** like over a decade ago. Why are we doing this right now where we are backtracking on the things that we already know to be true? I mean, it doesn't really make any sense to me why it‚Äôs hard to distinguish the inactive window.\n\nThere‚Äôs *so much* in this episode. This snippet in particular highlights that there‚Äôs a disdain for making interfaces usable within Apple. I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs even their third or fifth priority. I worry it‚Äôs *not even on their list*.\n\nJohn Gruber also had the opportunity to ask Alan Dye years ago about how Apple Watch handled overlapping hour, minute, and second hands on analog watch faces:\n\n> Every physical watch with analog hands, the hands are stacked in the same order: where the hour hand is on the bottom, the minute hand is on top of the hour hand, and if there's a second hand, it's on top of the minute hand so that the hours, minutes, seconds are going forward.\n> \n> An Apple Watch renders the hands in the same Z-axis order. It‚Äôs not perfectly flat. And they render a sort of shadow around things so that you could see like when the minute hand is slightly overlapping‚Ä¶\n> \n> I had a question about the light source for the shadow, and I was like, *oh finally*, I get to ask Alan Dye about this.\n> \n> And he was like, ‚ÄúOh, we render a shadow?‚Äù\n> \n> I just instantly realized: you‚Äôd never really even looked at it that closely. Like *somebody* at Apple has, but Alan Dye didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I just remember thinking at that very moment, it just suddenly came to me, ‚Äúoh, he doesn't do what I thought he did.‚Äù\n\nRelated, a bit later (around the 2 hr 31 min mark) from Louie:\n> [Steve] had a level of familiarity with [details]. I don't just know this because *my team* worked on it. I know it because I use it every day.\n\nAt first blush, it may seem unfair to criticize a VP at a multi-trillion-dollar corporation with this sort of minutia. But this is the *watch face* of the Apple Watch. (It‚Äôs not some [obscure macOS system settings screen](https://mastodon.social/@siracusa/114898428763571700) where the default system colors have now changed and now it‚Äôs impossible to distinguish which item is selected.) As someone who uses an Apple Watch **I** have personally seen this shadow. Once or twice in the 10 years of wearing this dang computer on my wrist I‚Äôve looked down at my wrist and it‚Äôs been 1:05, 2:10 or 3:15, and so on. If you have an Apple Watch, you, (yes, even you dear reader!) probably have seen this shadow too.\n\nIt‚Äôs like Alan Dye has never used the computers his teams are responsible for designing.\n\n---\n\nThere‚Äôs a great segment about John‚Äôs [Auteur Theory of Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbrfsXYoyCI&pp=ygUUYXV0ZWFyIGRlaXNnbiBncnViZXI%3D) where he talks about how authorship differs between books (Mark Twain‚Äôs *Huckleberry Finn*), film (Steven Spielberg‚Äôs *Jaws*), and software (an app, and operating system, etc) as the number of people involved increases:\n\n> John Gruber: My conclusion was that the level of quality of the work of a company, whether it‚Äôs hardware or software or something in between, eventually rises or falls to the level of taste of the person who‚Äôs *ultimately in charge* of it and gets to say yes or no. And I think we‚Äôre seeing Apple's UI design, not the styling, which is a separate issue, but the quality of the semantic design of the user interface, sort of fall apart because like you said, I don't know that there is person. It‚Äôs like trying to make a movie without a director.\n\n> Louie Mantia: I think all of these people can collectively say, ‚Äúthis is their app‚Äù, or ‚Äúthis is their OS that they worked on,‚Äù that they are the author. I think everyone who works on this stuff is entitled to say that they made it ‚Äî unequivocally. But there has to be this person and that **everyone‚Äôs meeting that vision**. And I've used the word ‚Äúvision‚Äù to describe this thing like directorial stuff. There is someone's vision that they have and when it meets that, that‚Äôs when we‚Äôre shipping.\n\n---\n\nThere‚Äôs a great analogy of a costume designer for a Wes Anderson movie. That person (likely) doesn‚Äôt dress like a Wes Anderson character every day in real life. But when they to work on a Wes Anderson movie, they know what‚Äôs *expected of them* and they rise to that bar and adjust their taste. They know the assignment.\n\nFrom Louie Mantia, around 2 hr 32 min:\n> My question that I‚Äôve had is, why does [Alan Dye] have this job? Why is he the person that does it?\n> \n> Even if you don't think Wes Anderson makes the best movies, I think we have to agree, he is the definition of that auteur ‚Äî one-million percent that kind of person ‚Äî so you have this clear vision and everyone is in service of that. You see it in the people that are the cinematographers, you see it in the people that are the actors that he chooses, everyone there is fully committed to the vision and I think that was true when Steve was there.\n> \n> Everyone, and I‚Äôve talked with friends at Apple that have been there, that used to work there, people I used to work with, everyone agrees about this: Everyone was happy to let go of their own personal idea of how things should be in service of the **vision** that Steve generally had. Yes we were still making all these individual decisions. Yes we were still deciding how, but we were all in the back of our minds, ‚Äúlike what is the thing that we are guiding towards?‚Äù and it was always toward the vision that Steve.\n\nWhen I rejoined John¬†Deere a couple years ago we were going through a transformation (following the [Silicon Valley Product Group](https://www.svpg.com/) model). We had someone whose title literally has ‚Äúdirector‚Äù in it who started establishing large reviews for upcoming features with a few goals: increase awareness across the organization, break down silo walls, improve collaboration, and raise the quality bar. This person would attend these reviews and provide honest (and fair!) feedback. Quite often their critique was not that the designs ‚Äúweren‚Äôt good‚Äù, but that the team hadn‚Äôt considered all the various parts of our ecosystem and failed to loop-in teams should have been looped-in.\n\nThis person‚Äôs goal was to **elevate the quality** of the entire organization. This level of scrutiny and attention to detail meant that everyone started *thinking differently*. We all started thinking, ‚Äúwe better do a good job on this and think end-to-end because we know we‚Äôll get that feedback from you-know-who.‚Äù Over the years I‚Äôve noticed this director‚Äôs presence a bit less in these reviews (except for big things) but the process and practice changes have remained. We know that this person *could* show up and we all strive to do better work because of it.\n\nThat‚Äôs what I think about when I hear about Gruber and Louie talk about **vision** and improving quality. We have to aspire and reach to make things of high quality. It doesn‚Äôt happen just by hiring talented people, you have to push a bit.\n\n---\n\nAround 2 hr 40 min:\n> *Gruber:* [Talking about Aqua] The language of that era of Apple design encompassed that range that Steve Jobs set out to cover from novice to pro.\n\n> *Louie:* The style of Aqua was so adaptable and that‚Äôs what made it work. Those productivity tools (Final Cut, Logic) didn‚Äôt ignore Aqua. They acknowledged Aqua. They understood what it was trying to do. They adapted it to their product. Aperture was entirely graphic, right? Even GarageBand was super playful, right? GarageBand had wood on the side of the thing but it took away almost no screen real estate‚Ä¶ but it puts you in a mood. It puts a visual clarity on what *this* app is versus what this *other* app is. At no point did it look like it was not part of the same system. There was a **visual richness** to Aqua that was like: so the system looks like *this*. Even if we have buttons that are rich Corinthian leather, even if we have buttons that are wood, right? Even if we have these other materials, they need to match this level of quality, of this visual quality that [Aqua] has.\n> \n> Everyone is working on this movie, right? Everyone sees what the direction is and everyone‚Äôs like, okay, so in the ‚ÄúAqua Cinematic Universe‚Äù, there's actually more room for it than just Aqua, right? And that was true on iOS too. Early iOS stuff, when it was iPhoneOS: iPhone OS had all of these different kinds of material qualities to it where any app could do whatever we wanted, especially because it was taking up the full screen at the time. You could do anything and it was *not* incongruous with the system. As long as you acknowledged what the system was trying to do, then you could play with a little bit.\n> \n> Can you do that with Liquid Glass? Because it feels to me that if it doesn‚Äôt look like Liquid Glass, then it looks wrong on the platform, right? There's no alternative quality. There‚Äôs no alternative material to use. It‚Äôs not like you can suddenly use paper, but make it looks like it belongs in the ‚ÄúLiquid Glass Cinematic Universe.‚Äù\n\n> *Gruber:* And that‚Äôs why I'm so disappointed overall with the big new UI [redesign]. We didn't even know what it was supposed to look like, but there were rumors for the last year that Apple‚Äôs doing a big platforms-spanning UI redesign and that it‚Äôs going to add some kind of texture and glass and something. I was so hopeful that it would bring back some of that era. Some of that tactical quality, some of that richness.\n\nThere‚Äôs a lot to unpack here and I just loved this segment.\n\nAfter some time with macOS Tahoe, I find myself getting lost at glance in a sea of sameness. As an industry we‚Äôve been chasing down *consistency* and *design systems* for basically forever. Familiarity has amazing qualities. It means you can learn one piece of software and have that translate across the system. (For example: once you learn system features like the macOS menu bar or *Customize Toolbar*, all your apps open up to you. To borrow an old Cocoa/AppKit analogy: you‚Äôre starting on the third floor instead of the basement.)\n\nThis *sea of sameness* across macOS presents itself: every window is expanse of white with glass buttons (with terrible toolbar gradient shadows). Nothing is visually identifiable at a glance.\n\nFrom John Gruber, around 21 min:\n> But say what you want about the [stitched leather]. ‚ÄúOh, I like the way that looks‚Äù or ‚ÄúI like the gimmick‚Äù of the way it looks. It undeniably made the Calendar window instantly recognizable. \n\nNot only is there very little character left in these apps they‚Äôre *overly* same-y and harder to differentiate when using the system as a whole.\n\n---\n\nOn platform familiarity, here‚Äôs around 2 hr 20 min:\n\n> *John:* Xcode is a pretty good example of standard good Apple Mac UI design. And I know that you [random developer] have been using it for years because you‚Äôve been making iOS apps for years. But somehow you've been using Xcode and not paying *any* attention whatsoever to the interface?\n\n> *Louie:* I‚Äôm not saying this is the cause, but I do wonder, over the years with the iOS-ification of a bunch of things and with iOS becoming like a more dominant platform in everyone‚Äôs hands, there‚Äôs also been simultaneously a decrease in macOS. ‚Ä¶ A lot of people use Safari as an interface for web apps that they use *a lot* more. Some people‚Äôs docks look like Finder, Safari, Trash. And you're like, ‚Äúwhat? I can't even imagine it.‚Äù But that is how some people live.\n\nI do have hope for the future. My suggestion to all designers, whether you work at Apple or anywhere else, is to take some time to understand the [underlying foundations](https://www.nngroup.com/books/tog-on-interface/) of what makes the Mac great. I worry designers who sit in front of a Mac 8 hours a day don‚Äôt understand just how great it is *beneath the surface* (how menus work, how keyboard navigation works, etc) and are content with throwing a design over the wall to their developers.\n\nAs a result you‚Äôre only thinking surface-level about your designs, putting together LEGO-pieces from your design system and that‚Äôs about it.\n\n---\n\nBefore I sign off for this post, I also want to direct your attention to a complimentary podcast episode:\n\nIn [ATP 650](https://atp.fm/650) John Siracusa talks about how UI design is a **science** and an **art**.

(Thank goodness for [iCloud Shared Photo Library](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118229).)\n- Listened to many hours of [_Roderick on the Line_](http://www.merlinmann.com/Roderick/) on our several road trips.\n- Went axe throwing at a work event. Fun!\n- Replaced the power lift gate on our RAV4 that was stuck shut. Not fun!\n\nDuring the evenings when everyone went to bed:\n- Worked on a big update to [MapKeep](/2024/08/31/mapkeep.html) and a few [smaller updates](/2024/09/22/dark-and-tinted.html). It was great having some spare brain power to refactor the app after a year of stumbling through re-learning app development.\n- Played _Zelda Twilight Princess_ on my newly arrived [Odin 2 mini](https://www.ayntec.com/products/odin2-mini) as I waited for _Zelda Echoes of Wisdom_ to arrive.\n- Finished _Pok√©mon Crystal_.\n- Added a [now](/now) page to this site where you can see what I‚Äôm up to outside of blog posts. I also upgraded this site to [Eleventy version 3](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-v3/).\n- Listened to new albums by [Maggie Rogers](https://music.apple.com/us/album/dont-forget-me/1727422029), [Charly Bliss](https://music.apple.com/us/album/forever/1738100076), [Clairo](https://music.apple.com/us/album/charm/1742301413) and discovered [American Football](https://music.apple.com/us/album/american-football-deluxe-edition/1651301990) after learning [their house](https://pitchfork.com/news/american-football-house-available-to-rent-on-airbnb/) is near me.\n\nTV shows watched:\n- [_The Acolyte_ (Star Wars)](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/114479-the-acolyte) had so much potential. Interesting themes but strange pacing and seemingly low-budget at times (despite having a **massive** budget).\n- [_30 Rock_](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/4608-30-rock) seasons 4 and 5.\n- [_Penelope_](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/241773-penelope) was slow to start but we loved it. Reminds me to savor nature. I heard about the show in an [episode of *The Town*](https://www.theringer.com/2024/9/25/24253629/how-to-make-your-own-tv-show-and-get-netflix-to-buy-it-mark-duplass-penelope-netflix) with Mark Duplass who self-funded the show.\n- [Sunny](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/157226-sunny) had a great hook, fantastic style, Rashida Jones, Japan‚Ä¶ but it felt a bit all over the place like it was confused about who was doing what and why.\n\nStarted watching [_The Penguin_](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/194764-the-penguin), [_Rings of Power_](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/84773-the-lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power) season 2, [_English Teacher_](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/258902-english-teacher) (Stephanie Koenig is a treasure), and [Hacks](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/124101-hacks) is outstanding.\n",

Recent mainstream events like [Scarlett Johansson‚Äôs kerfuffle with OpenAI](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/20/1252495087/openai-pulls-ai-voice-that-was-compared-to-scarlett-johansson-in-the-movie-her) and [Google telling people to eat rocks and glue](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd11gzejgz4o) put a spotlight on the ethical and technical issues with AI technology and the companies hawking these new-fangled products.\n\nPutting that aside for a moment, I am extremely optimistic for what Apple can bring to this space. I enjoy talking with ChatGPT via voice (and subsequent fact checking it) and using it to help me code but I think AI will remain a party trick until it‚Äôs fully embedded in our phones and computers.\n\nThings like the Apple Photos widget and iOS 17‚Äôs autocorrect _are already AI_ and I think there‚Äôs hundreds of ways that AI could help us get things done on our computers in new and faster ways. So count me in as someone who is very excited to see what we‚Äôll get on Monday.\n\nBut don‚Äôt get _too_ excited. I think iOS 18 will just be the start of a long journey to incorporate these new technologies into our operating systems. I think we‚Äôre going to be surprised and impressed come Monday but also let down. Both things can be true. There‚Äôs too much hype and anticipation for Apple to solve everything in one year.\n",

Their marketing claims it works great in ‚Äúany browser‚Äù but apparently that generous definition does not extend to Safari for iPad. If you use it directly in the browser you get weird behavior. For example, pinching with your fingers will zoom the canvas where pinching on a trackpad will zoom the entire web page. There is <a href=\"https://figurative.design/\">Figurative</a> but this has its own tradeoffs: if I left and came back it would force reload the file because it was ‚Äúout of memory‚Äù and irritatingly ‚åòc and ‚åòv don‚Äôt work.

I used <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/fonts/\">SF Pro Rounded</a> for my button labels and I completely bailed on trying to get this onto iPad. Apple provides these fonts in a macOS Installer within a <code>.dmg</code> file, which is to decidedly <em>not</em> iPadOS-friendly. How does Figma handle missing fonts? Well by making text uneditable. Fun.</p>\n<p>Exporting PDFs out of Figma into the Files app worked great and I was able to get a lot of design work done from my iPad. It was slow-going and the font issue ultimately drove me back to the Mac.</p>\n<p>I have an itch to try making a Figma plugin to make it super easy to create Delta skins. That‚Äôs for another day though.</p>\n<h2 id=\"editing-json\">Editing JSON</h2>\n<p>Delta‚Äôs skin system is pretty straightforward. You provide PDFs of the UI your users will see and then give the coordinates of all the buttons in a JSON file.

This is far more approachable as you no longer need to think of the syntax for JSON and making a mistake. But it also involved a lot of navigating in-and-out due to the hierarchy of Delta‚Äôs skin system (where you have to drill into <code>dictionary 0</code> to see it‚Äôs the ‚ÄúA‚Äù button then back out to adjust its coordinates). Using this was better than typing manually, for sure, but I think there‚Äôs a lot of opportunity for Simon to optimize this app for fewer clicks and faster navigating up-and-down the hierarchy.</p>\n<p>This app is also available on macOS but it‚Äôs a bare-minimum Catalyst version of the iPad app. (Sorry if I sound negative!

In 1.2 you can now switch to satellite view using the map style button.</p>\n<p>After using the app for 6 months, my map was super cluttered with all the pins I‚Äôve saved. (Especially on Apple Watch!) This update adds <strong>date filters</strong>. Just look for the calendar button on the map.</p>\n<p>Neither feature are fully baked ‚Äî the date options aren‚Äôt ideal and your options don‚Äôt persist between sessions ‚Äî but I had a specific timeline<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> in mind to get this update out the door.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-enhancements\">Other Enhancements</h2>\n<p>I wanted to improve how the app works when the user hasn‚Äôt granted location access. Previously the map was completely blocked if location access was denied. This didn‚Äôt sit right with me for a few reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With 1.1‚Äôs ‚Äúlong press to add‚Äù you don‚Äôt <em>technically</em> need location permission to use the app.</li>\n<li>If you created pins <em>then</em> denied location access, it was impossible to view (or export) your collection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now the app feels more seamless than before; the splashy request location view gets replaced with the ‚Äúadd‚Äù button after location is permitted.

				"content_text": "\nYesterday I launched version 1.2 of [MapKeep](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833) ‚Äî an iPhone and Apple Watch app that lets you capture your current location in one tap ‚Äî with a few useful features.\n\n## New Features\nSince adding the ‚Äúlong press to add‚Äù feature in version 1.1 I‚Äôve wanted a **satellite view** of the map to give a better sense of where to place the pin. In 1.2 you can now switch to satellite view using the map style button.\n\nAfter using the app for 6 months, my map was super cluttered with all the pins I‚Äôve saved. (Especially on Apple Watch!) This update adds **date filters**. Just look for the calendar button on the map.\n\nNeither feature are fully baked ‚Äî the date options aren‚Äôt ideal and your options don‚Äôt persist between sessions ‚Äî but I had a specific timeline[^1] in mind to get this update out the door.\n\n## Other Enhancements\nI wanted to improve how the app works when the user hasn‚Äôt granted location access. Previously the map was completely blocked if location access was denied. This didn‚Äôt sit right with me for a few reasons:\n- With 1.1‚Äôs ‚Äúlong press to add‚Äù you don‚Äôt _technically_ need location permission to use the app.\n- If you created pins _then_ denied location access, it was impossible to view (or export) your collection.\n\nNow the app feels more seamless than before; the splashy request location view gets replaced with the ‚Äúadd‚Äù button after location is permitted. Simple. Even though the app is completely private, I wanted to go above and beyond here.\n\n## Bugs\nLastly it seems like a [SwiftUI bug](https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/748996) was introduced in iOS 17.3 or 17.4 having to do with using `@Environment` with `modelContainer`. If you created a pin on Apple Watch it would wake up the iPhone app in the background to sync with iCloud then crash silently in the background. I have a workaround to fix this but it‚Äôs not ideal.\n\n## Wrap Up\n\nThe theme here is that I‚Äôm glad I shipped this update but I feel like there‚Äôs a lot of room for improvement. I hope to chip away at this before WWDC hits early June. Time will tell.\n\nIf you find a use for the app or want to share feedback please [reach out](/about)!\n\n[^1]: Moments after hitting the ‚Äúsubmit for review‚Äù button my wife and I left for the hospital to give birth to our first-born.

This involved a lot of reading, podcasts, doing [freelance](https://www.neutraldesignstudio.com) and [pro-bono](https://www.linkedin.com/company/alzcare-labs) side projects, and visiting friends who worked in the Austin and San Francisco tech startup scenes.\n\nI‚Äôve let that slide in recent years[^2] but I figured I could share the books, podcasts, and videos that helped me along the way.\n\n## Podcasts \nWhile the majority of these shows are now retired I consider them to be evergreen.\n\n- *[Design Matters](https://www.designmattersmedia.com)* by Debbie Millman is about creative people from a wide array of disciplines.\n- *[High Resolution](https://www.highresolution.design)* by Bobby Ghoshal and Jared Erondu was a limited-run show where they interviewed design leaders.\n- *[Layout](https://layout.fm)* by Kevin Clark and Rafael Conde was a good (semi-topical) show that helped me feel connected to the broader design community.\n- *[Presentable](https://www.relay.fm/presentable)* by Jeff Veen is a great set of interviews with design experts.\n\n## Books\n\n- *[Build](https://www.buildc.com/the-book)* by Tony Fadell includes lessons from creating the iPod and Nest.\n- *[Creativity Inc.](https://www.amazon.com/Creativity-Inc-Overcoming-Unseen-Inspiration/dp/0812993012)* by Ed Catmull is about how Pixar makes and tests movies iteratively.\n- *[The Design of Everyday Things](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262525671/the-design-of-everyday-things/)* by Don Norman is all about affordances.\n- *[Don‚Äôt Make Me Think](https://sensible.com/dont-make-me-think/)* by Steve Krug is about usability testing.\n- *[It Doesn‚Äôt Have to Be Crazy at Work](https://basecamp.com/books/calm)* by Jason Fried and Daniel Heinemeier Hansson[^3] is about bucking the work-obsessed Silicon Valley culture.\n- *[The Ten Faces of Innovation](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385512074/theartofinnovat/102-0654687-1650515)* by Tom Kelley of [IDEO](https://www.ideo.com/) is about the roles of innovative teams. It‚Äôs summarized in this [post](https://www.ideo.com/journal/the-ten-faces-of-innovation).\n- *[100 Things: Every Designer Needs to Know About People](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10778139-100-things-every-designer-needs-to-know-about-people)* by Susan M. Weinschenk, Ph.D. is about the intersection of psychology and design.\n\n## Videos\n- [AJ&Smart‚Äôs workshop videos](https://www.youtube.com/@AJSmart/playlists) do a great job at demystifying facilitation.\n- [Apple‚Äôs Design videos](https://developer.apple.com/videos/design/) are top-notch.\n\n[^1]: As an example of ‚Äúdesign philosophy‚Äù they recommended *[The Shape of Design](https://shapeofdesignbook.com)* by Frank Chimera.\n\n[^2]: I have a backlog of design organization books by O‚ÄôReilly (graciously purchased by my employer): *Articulating Design Decisions*, *Discussing Design*, *Org Design for Design Orgs*, *Design Leadership*, and *UX Strategy*.\n\n[^3]: At the time of this book being released (2018) I looked up to the culture DHH helped establish at [37signals](https://37signals.com) but since then he‚Äôs turned out to be a turd.\n",

I bought [one of these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C7G8V4PC?ie=UTF8&psc=1) on a whim back in November with the expectation it could address a few issues with Apple‚Äôs Magic Mouse:\n\n1. Increase the bulk of the mouse to help my hand rest more comfortably.\n2.

Despite its derisive design, I‚Äôm not sure how Apple could have made two-finger scrolling more comfortable.\n\n## Wireless Charging\nAdding wireless charging to Magic Mouse is nicer than spearing the turtle with a lightning cable. I could quickly attach the mouse to a MagSafe puck when getting up for lunch meaning the battery would always be topped up.\n\nOne downside is that is causes a *tiny* electrical hum when charging.

				"content_html": "<h2 id=\"preamble\">Preamble</h2>\n<p>My goal is to collect the stories and art I experienced in 2023 with a sprinkle of personal updates. Reflecting on the year was a fun process and I hope to turn this into an annual tradition.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tech-stories\">Tech Stories</h2>\n<p>There were a lot of disastrous tech stories this year but <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/23andme-credential-stuffing-data-stolen/\">23andMe‚Äôs data breach</a> has a special spot in my heart. When I think about the implications for how this data could be misused (off the dome: planting false evidence at a crime scene, the inevitability of nonconsensual cloning), I have a hard time racking my brain for data that‚Äôs more sensitive. Stories like this <em>should</em> remind us to be more thoughtful of what we put online. Based on what I see on LinkedIn (a ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù network), society has ways to go.</p>\n<p>Other stories that spring to mind are <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/gm-justifies-decision-to-ditch-apple-carplay-due-to-stability-issues/\">GM‚Äôs bone-headed decision to drop CarPlay</a> and the spectacular bungled effort to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23981848/sam-altman-back-open-ai-ceo-microsoft-board\">fire Sam Altman</a>. The world came <em>this close</em> to Microsoft hiring every employee from OpenAI.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Speaking of close calls: <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-adobe-abandon-proposed-merger/\">Adobe almost acquired Figma</a>. I‚Äôm bummed for the Figma employees (who missed out on a big windfall) but this is probably for the best.</p>\n<p>We saw the <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/12/31/elon-musks-x-fidelity-valuation-cut\">collapse of Twitter</a>, which was bound to happen, but did anyone think it‚Äôd deteriorate this quickly? In its wake we saw the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/10/23787453/meta-instagram-threads-100-million-users-milestone\">meteoric launch of Threads</a> and <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/\">Mastodon‚Äôs</a> slow-and-steady growth. I hope smaller services like <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">Micro.blog</a> are getting their day in the sun. In 2024 and beyond I‚Äôm ready for a <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-commentary/internet-future-about-to-get-weird-1234938403/\">weirder internet</a>.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs for these reasons I‚Äôm starting a blog.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> After years of posting to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andrewhaglund\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/andrewhaglund/\">Instagram</a>, it‚Äôs time to have a proper home on the web. I‚Äôve settled on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Short, frequent posts on <a href=\"https://hachyderm.io/@haglund\">Mastodon</a></li>\n<li>Long, infrequent posts here (<a href=\"/feed.xml\">subscribe via RSS</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-year-of-development\">The Year of Development</h2>\n<p>I prefer <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/cortex/150\">Yearly Themes</a> over resolutions and while I didn‚Äôt plan a theme for 2023, reflecting on the past year helped a theme emerge retroactively: <em>the Year of Development</em>.</p>\n<p>After the initial excitement of the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/wwdc23-highlights/\">Vision Pro unveiling at WWDC</a> I spent many summer nights and weekends learning SwiftUI and SwiftData. In September I launched my first app, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833\">MapKeep</a>.</p>\n<p>I noodled around with an app for Merlin Mann‚Äôs <a href=\"https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom/blob/master/wisdom.md\">Wisdom Project</a> and a packing/shopping list app based on Myke Hurley‚Äôs request in <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/489\">Upgrade 489</a>). These projects are on-hold for now.</p>\n<p>Weebly hosted my personal site for 10 years but I grew tired of its outdated editor and <em>godawful</em> blogging tools. I used this as an excuse to learn HTML/CSS and rebuilt my site from scratch. At the end of December the site was rebuilt again using <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev\">Eleventy</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"travel\">Travel</h2>\n<p>I visited Des Moines, IA, for a week every quarter for ‚Äúin-person week‚Äù at work. My brother happened to live there which meant we could get dinner downtown or watch an episode of <em>The Sopranos</em> at his apartment. Those days are behind us now that he‚Äôs moved to Chicago. It reminds me to always take advantage of opportunities to see family.</p>\n<p>I went to Florida to visit sugar cane growers in February. The area was recovering from <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/us/hurricane-ian-fort-myers-beach-florida/index.html\">Hurricane Ian</a> and the destruction was awful. Fort Myers Beach was on a boil order. The hotel was underwater days before I checked-in. I spent a few hours walking the beach and marveled at collapsed hotels, restaurants, and homes.</p>\n<p>In May we went to Michigan for a high-school friend‚Äôs wedding. A week later we went to a cousin‚Äôs high school graduation in Denver and we hiked at <a href=\"https://www.jeffco.us/1332/Mount-Falcon-Park\">Mount Falcon Park</a>.</p>\n<p>As an annual tradition we spent a week with my in-laws in Madison, WI, in June visiting downtown, breweries, and the <a href=\"https://union.wisc.edu/visit/terrace-at-the-memorial-union/\">UW Union Terrace</a>. In August we made a trip to Missouri for our niece‚Äôs 2nd birthday.</p>\n<p>At the end of September a close friend and college roommate got married in the Virginia/DC area. We had great time reminiscing over our stupidity in college.</p>\n<h2 id=\"work\">Work</h2>\n<p>I continue to work for John Deere as a UX Lead and love it. I was recently promoted and my area of responsibly has grown and I now directly manage a few designers.

				"content_text": "\n## Preamble\nMy goal is to collect the stories and art I experienced in 2023 with a sprinkle of personal updates. Reflecting on the year was a fun process and I hope to turn this into an annual tradition.\n\n## Tech Stories\nThere were a lot of disastrous tech stories this year but [23andMe‚Äôs data breach](https://www.wired.com/story/23andme-credential-stuffing-data-stolen/) has a special spot in my heart. When I think about the implications for how this data could be misused (off the dome: planting false evidence at a crime scene, the inevitability of nonconsensual cloning), I have a hard time racking my brain for data that‚Äôs more sensitive. Stories like this *should* remind us to be more thoughtful of what we put online. Based on what I see on LinkedIn (a ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù network), society has ways to go.\n\nOther stories that spring to mind are [GM‚Äôs bone-headed decision to drop CarPlay](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/gm-justifies-decision-to-ditch-apple-carplay-due-to-stability-issues/) and the spectacular bungled effort to [fire Sam Altman](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23981848/sam-altman-back-open-ai-ceo-microsoft-board). The world came *this close* to Microsoft hiring every employee from OpenAI.[^1]\n\nSpeaking of close calls: [Adobe almost acquired Figma](https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-adobe-abandon-proposed-merger/). I‚Äôm bummed for the Figma employees (who missed out on a big windfall) but this is probably for the best.\n\nWe saw the [collapse of Twitter](https://www.axios.com/2023/12/31/elon-musks-x-fidelity-valuation-cut), which was bound to happen, but did anyone think it‚Äôd deteriorate this quickly? In its wake we saw the [meteoric launch of Threads](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/10/23787453/meta-instagram-threads-100-million-users-milestone) and [Mastodon‚Äôs](https://joinmastodon.org/) slow-and-steady growth. I hope smaller services like [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) are getting their day in the sun. In 2024 and beyond I‚Äôm ready for a [weirder internet](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-commentary/internet-future-about-to-get-weird-1234938403/).\n\nIt‚Äôs for these reasons I‚Äôm starting a blog.[^2] After years of posting to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrewhaglund) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/andrewhaglund/), it‚Äôs time to have a proper home on the web. I‚Äôve settled on:\n- Short, frequent posts on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@haglund)\n- Long, infrequent posts here ([subscribe via RSS](/feed.xml))\n\n## The Year of Development\nI prefer [Yearly Themes](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/150) over resolutions and while I didn‚Äôt plan a theme for 2023, reflecting on the past year helped a theme emerge retroactively: *the Year of Development*.\n\nAfter the initial excitement of the [Vision Pro unveiling at WWDC](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/wwdc23-highlights/) I spent many summer nights and weekends learning SwiftUI and SwiftData. In September I launched my first app, [MapKeep](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833).\n\nI noodled around with an app for Merlin Mann‚Äôs [Wisdom Project](https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom/blob/master/wisdom.md) and a packing/shopping list app based on Myke Hurley‚Äôs request in [Upgrade 489](https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/489)). These projects are on-hold for now.\n\nWeebly hosted my personal site for 10 years but I grew tired of its outdated editor and *godawful* blogging tools. I used this as an excuse to learn HTML/CSS and rebuilt my site from scratch. At the end of December the site was rebuilt again using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev).\n\n## Travel\nI visited Des Moines, IA, for a week every quarter for ‚Äúin-person week‚Äù at work. My brother happened to live there which meant we could get dinner downtown or watch an episode of *The Sopranos* at his apartment. Those days are behind us now that he‚Äôs moved to Chicago. It reminds me to always take advantage of opportunities to see family.\n\nI went to Florida to visit sugar cane growers in February. The area was recovering from [Hurricane Ian](https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/us/hurricane-ian-fort-myers-beach-florida/index.html) and the destruction was awful. Fort Myers Beach was on a boil order. The hotel was underwater days before I checked-in. I spent a few hours walking the beach and marveled at collapsed hotels, restaurants, and homes.\n\nIn May we went to Michigan for a high-school friend‚Äôs wedding. A week later we went to a cousin‚Äôs high school graduation in Denver and we hiked at [Mount Falcon Park](https://www.jeffco.us/1332/Mount-Falcon-Park).\n\nAs an annual tradition we spent a week with my in-laws in Madison, WI, in June visiting downtown, breweries, and the [UW Union Terrace](https://union.wisc.edu/visit/terrace-at-the-memorial-union/). In August we made a trip to Missouri for our niece‚Äôs 2nd birthday.\n\nAt the end of September a close friend and college roommate got married in the Virginia/DC area. We had great time reminiscing over our stupidity in college.\n\n## Work\nI continue to work for John Deere as a UX Lead and love it. I was recently promoted and my area of responsibly has grown and I now directly manage a few designers. I‚Äôm adjusting to the new role and I‚Äôll be reading *[The First 90 Days](https://hbr.org/books/watkins)* ASAP.\n\nI‚Äôm fortunate to have a [great mentor and manager](https://inkypixelsdesign.com). This was a tough year for layoffs across a lot of industries and I don‚Äôt take my position for granted.\n\nI try to stay connected with the University of Illinois and in March I gave a talk about the design process at the [Siebel Center of Design](https://designcenter.illinois.edu/).\n\n---\n\n## Games\nI‚Äôm approaching the end of the main storyline in *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom* and ‚Ä¶ what a masterpiece. *Mario Wonder* was a blast! 2023 was [filled with amazing games](https://intothecast.transistor.fm/episodes/the-2023-game-of-the-year-spectacular) and I expect my [OLED Steam Deck](https://www.steamdeck.com/oled) can help expose me to more non-Nintendo games in 2024.\n\nI‚Äôve been playing retro games:\n- *Pok√©mon Red* ([Anniversary romhack](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/2362/)) and *Tetris* on my silver [Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket).\n- The [PC port](https://www.shipofharkinian.com) of *Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time* on the Mac.\n- *Super Mario World*, naturally.\n\nThis Christmas the [Genki dock](https://www.genkithings.com/products/covert-dock-2) let my cousins and I (ranging from ages 12 to 32) play local co-op with 6-players in *Super Smash Bros*. Chaotic joy.\n\n## Podcasts\nI heard the podcast ad market was tough in 2023. Hosts would mention this occasionally and I noticed fewer (or zero) ads. I decided to open [my wallet](https://bellroy.com/products/card-sleeve-wallet?color=hazelnut&material=leather&size=default) and financially support the work I love:\n\n- *[Accidental Tech Podcast](https://atp.fm/)*: Exceptionally consistent. Gotta support John now that [he‚Äôs gone indie](https://hypercritical.co/2022/03/30/independence-day).\n- *[Into the Aether](https://intothecast.online)*: I have a tremendous appreciation for the art of video game creation thanks to Brendon and Stephen.\n- *[Roderick on the Line](http://www.merlinmann.com/Roderick/)*: I‚Äôve been listening to the internet‚Äôs Merlin Mann and the Long Winters‚Äô John Roderick for a *long time*.\n- *[Upgrade](https://www.relay.fm/upgrade)*: Myke and Jason‚Äôs segments on Apple and the entertainment industry keep me coming back week after week.\n\nI loved [Sir McCartney‚Äôs show](https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/mccartney-a-life-in-lyrics) where he tells the stories behind his killer songs.[^3]\n\nIn 2024 I want to reduce my podcast intake or introduce more variety. It‚Äôs too easy for me to pop-in an AirPod and tune-out the world. I‚Äôm not giving myself enough time for silence.\n\n## Music\nThanks to Apple Music‚Äôs awkward [Replay](https://replay.music.apple.com/) feature I have a list of most-listened music from 2023:\n\n- *[the record](https://boygenius.lnk.to/therecord)* by boygenius\n- *[GUTS](https://oliviarodrigo.lnk.to/GUTS)* by Olivia Rodrigo\n- *[Fantasy](https://m83.lnk.to/fantasy)* by M83\n- *[WE](https://af.lnk.to/_WEAW)* by Arcade Fire (2022)\n- *[Multitudes](https://interscope.lnk.to/Multitudes)* by Feist\n- *[Asphalt Meadows (Acoustic)](https://death-cab-for-cutie.lnk.to/AMAcoustic)* by Death Cab for Cutie\n- *[The Land Is Hospitable and So Are We](https://mitski.lnk.to/TLIIASAW)* by Mitski\n- *[Oppenheimer](https://music.apple.com/us/album/oppenheimer-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1697599270)* by Ludwig G√∂ransson\n- *[Random Access Memories](https://daftpunk.lnk.to/RAM_Originals)* by Daft Punk (2013) is routinely played on Friday afternoons as work winds down. (I will **not** link to the drumless abomination.)\n\nOther music highlights:\n- I started digging into Peter Gabriel‚Äôs *[i/o](https://lnk.to/PG21)*. There are 3 mixes of the album which is fascinating. I can‚Äôt explain it but the acoustic guitar in the opening track *Panopticom* fills me with joy.\n- Sufjan Stevens‚Äô *[Javelin](https://sufjanstevens.lnk.to/javelin)* was lovely but I haven‚Äôt listened to it enough.\n- I recorded a short composition called [*A Quiet Night*](https://soundcloud.com/andrewhaglund/a-quiet-night).\n- As part of a Christmas gift I introduced my brother to some chords on the guitar.\n- My hopes are high for Michael Stipe‚Äôs [first post-R.E.M. album](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/03/magazine/michael-stipe-solo-album.html) (I first heard it teased on [Smartless](https://www.smartless.com/episodes/episode/24585bee/michael-stipe)). The [*Up* remaster](https://found.ee/rem-up25) was impeccable.\n\nLive shows:\n- [Rodrigo y Gabriela](https://www.rodgab.com) at Krannert‚Äôs [Ellnora](https://krannertcenter.com/ellnora) festival. They‚Äôre gods. (Thanks to Se√±ora Kooy, my high school Spanish teacher, who originally introduced me to this duo.)\n- [Lauren Mayberry](https://laurenmayberry.co.uk) of Churches at the Rose Bowl. I missed seeing her opener, [Claud](https://toastmp3.bandcamp.com/album/supermodels) whose record is a gift to humanity.\n- YouTube concerts don‚Äôt count but my brother was at a very similar show to [Bon Iver at Pitchfork](https://youtu.be/TolZh65YsmM?si=mGJnauI28TmKEXYv).\n\nOne last note: we all heard a new Beatles song this year. Its authenticity is contentious but seeing [people singing *Now and Then* in Central Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzcsKb8iLY&pp=ygUZbm93IGFuZCB0aGVuIGNlbnRyYWwgcGFyaw%3D%3D) is something. It‚Äôs hard to imagine this song hasn‚Äôt been around for 50 years.\n\n## Reading\nI started supporting [kottke.org](https://kottke.org) by becoming a [member](https://kottke.org/members). His site is an invaluable source of information on the internet across a variety of topics and help satiates my curiosity.\n\nI read *[Expecting Better](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/310896/expecting-better-by-emily-oster/)* which is the *Freakonomics* of pregnancy.\n\n30 seconds into Apple‚Äôs trailer for [*Silo*](https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2023/06/apple-tv-renews-hit-world-building-drama-silo-for-season-two/) and I was hooked. Before the show aired I read the first book, *[Wool](https://hughhowey.com/books/wool/)*. I‚Äôm currently reading *[Shift](https://hughhowey.com/books/shift/)*, book 2 of 3. If you‚Äôre a fan of the show, read the books.\n\n(I *think* I read more than this but I don‚Äôt have a good tracking system.)\n\n\n## Movies\nThroughout the year I used [Sofa](https://www.sofahq.com) to track what I watched. Stars indicate favorites ‚òÖ.\n\n- Dec: Barbie ‚òÖ\n- Dec: Knocked Up (rewatch)\n- Dec: National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (rewatch)\n- Dec: Godzilla Minus One ‚òÖ\n- Nov: A Charlie Brown Christmas (rewatch)\n- Nov: David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived\n- Oct: Young Frankenstein (rewatch)\n- Oct: Flora and Son\n- Oct: The Swan\n- Oct: You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah\n- Oct: Flight of the Conchords: Live in London (rewatch)\n- Oct: The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar\n- Sep: Elemental\n- Sep: Death on the Nile\n- Sep: John Mulaney: Baby J\n- Sep: Air\n- Aug: Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse ‚òÖ\n- Aug: Once Upon a Time‚Ä¶ in Hollywood\n- Aug: The Beanie Bubble\n- Jul: Oppenheimer ‚òÖ\n- Apr: The Super Mario Bros.
