Before brunch was served the host asked everyone to hold hands for a blessing. Once the table settled in, hand in hand with closed eyes, the host began to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. My parents peeked to scan the room to assess <em>were they for real?</em> while the group quietly recited along with the host. When it was over the group started eating.

				"content_text": "Last night my parents told me a fun story that I wanted to relay to the world:\n\nMy parents spent this past Easter with friends. Before brunch was served the host asked everyone to hold hands for a blessing. Once the table settled in, hand in hand with closed eyes, the host began to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. My parents peeked to scan the room to assess _were they for real?_ while the group quietly recited along with the host. When it was over the group started eating. The moment passed.\n\nMonths later the host (a huge wiseass) told my parents it had been a prank. The entire table was in on the joke. They all too it so seriously and didn’t break _at all_ and intentionally waited months to reveal this fact — just to play it cool.\n\nKudos to them for playing such a well executed, and harmless, prank. It works on _so_ many levels but since my parents were the only non-family members how would they know this _wasn’t_ a legitimate tradition in this household? It also worked because they knew my parents wouldn’t want to ask in the moment. It could have been considered unpatriotic or worse, rude, to question someone another family’s rituals.\n\nThe kicker is that as they told me this story, I interrupted them immediately. “Oh, just like _Christmas Vacation_?” A movie we’ve all watched dozens of times over the years. [That moment](https://youtu.be/Aoj5qIZvwWA?si=MZYZTopSYgvdW-__) is seared into my brain and the lines leading up to it like, “Grace?

[These were his words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pledge_of_Allegiance#Recital). He was not questioned. \n\n---\n\nHappy Thanksgiving everyone, and to all a good night. 🦃\n",

I’m so glad my phone can be a Pokémon machine now and being able to steal a few minutes away or play one-handed while I hold my sleeping kid is such a joy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I’m almost done playing through <em>Pokémon Crystal</em> (well, technically <a href=\"https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal\">Polished Crystal</a>) in Delta and have published a couple <a href=\"https://deltastyles.com/user/92-andrewhaglund\">custom controller skins</a>. Having a go-to game on your phone is a sure-fire way to stay off social media.</li>\n<li>Played a little of <em>Hades 2</em> in early access (it’s phenomenal) on my Steam Deck and am looking forward to diving in again.</li>\n<li>I picked up <em>Paper Mario: Thousand Year Door</em> remake for the Switch and have been slowly working my way through it. (For context I just stared Chapter 1.) I played the original a long time ago and have fond memories.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also <a href=\"https://hachyderm.io/@haglund/112559467713943204\">modded my Gamesir G8 controller</a> to work with my new iPad. It’s a glorious combination.</p>\n<h2 id=\"music\">Music</h2>\n<p>Been enjoying new music from Vampire Weekend, Iron &amp; Wine, Hovvdy, Decemberists, Billie Eilish, and of course Taylor Swift.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to new Bright Eyes and Coldplay in Q3. Speaking of Coldplay: I think they played <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kr82k58qqo\">their best concert ever at Glastonbury</a>. It was an incredibly special performance with a lot of heart. Knowing 100k people were there in-person seeing what I was seeing at the <em>exact save time</em> was awe-inspiring.</p>\n<h2 id=\"movies--tv\">Movies &amp; TV</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Bad Batch</em> (season 3) went out with a bang. Love a good star war.</li>\n<li><em>30 Rock</em> (seasons 1–3) is sublime. To me it’s like a live-action cartoon and I am always here for the zaniness. Blink and you might miss three jokes. I just love Tracy Morgan, Jack McBrayer, and <em>everyone</em> in the cast. (Some jokes haven’t aged well but that’s kind of how comedy works.) ★</li>\n<li>My wife is rewatching <em>Modern Family</em> and I’ll catch a few episodes here and there. Holy hell. That show deserve all its Emmys, it’s such a treat.</li>\n<li><em>Fargo</em> (season 3) was good but nothing like seasons 1 and 2 (which were <em>outstanding</em>). We watched an episode of season 4 and kinda bailed on it. I like <em>Fargo</em> for the relatable characters — not the organized crime.</li>\n<li>The last season of <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em> (season 12) was fantastic. They nailed the finale. Pretty, <em>pretty</em> good.</li>\n<li><em>Chernobyl</em> (2019) was a rewatch for me. My wife never saw it and I was itching to rewatch it. It’s an amazing feat of film and one of the all-time greats.</li>\n<li><em>Demetri Martin: Demetri Deconstructed</em> was humorous and surreal. Interesting editing and pacing of a live standup session.</li>\n<li><em>BlackBerry</em> was excellent and such a funny and amazing “true story” movie. It makes you realize how far our current technology has come (and how amazing the iPhone is). I’d love to see Glenn Howerton in more serious roles going forward. ★</li>\n<li><em>Dream Scenario</em> was a classic A24 film and Nic Cage was great. While I liked it I couldn’t help but think that I was just watching an extended version of the trailer. It’s all in there, weirdly enough.</li>\n<li><em>Conan O’Brien Must Go</em> was a great laugh. Always been a fan of him and it’s fun seeing him have fun. ★</li>\n<li><em>Little Women</em> (2019) was great. I’m not sure why we watched this now — it might have been suggested in Hulu or something — but it’s a delightful movie. I was in a stage adaptation of this in high school (I can’t remember who I played) so I’ll always have a soft spot for this tale. (It was also interesting watching this after seeing <em>Barbie</em> since it was Gerwig’s previous project.)</li>\n<li><em>Castle in the Sky</em> is a masterpiece. Watching this made me realize how much <em>Zelda</em> borrows from Ghibli’s humor and style — everything from the nature, creatures, music, and floating cities were all just sitting there.</li>\n<li><em>Unfrosted</em> felt like an odd halfway between a kid’s movie and something for older audience. Not sure who this movie was for…? Just a big sugar-high mess of cameos. (Jack McBrayer and the <em>Mad Men</em> scene make it worthwhile in my book.) If this didn’t have Seinfeld attached there’s no way I would have watched it.</li>\n<li><em>Clueless</em> (1995) I <em>think</em> I had seen this once before but not sure. It was a fine romcom. Not sure how Paul Rudd still looks the same.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>As always I want to thank Shawn Hickman for making <a href=\"https://www.sofahq.com/\">Sofa</a>. I use it to queue up media and log when I’ve watched/played it.</p>\n",

As you can see it’s quite a bit less than [Q1](/2024/03/31/q-update.html)!\n\n## Games\nMy relationship with gaming is probably going to look a lot different going forward now that I have a kid: you rarely have two hands free for a controller with a newborn (let alone the time). I’m so glad my phone can be a Pokémon machine now and being able to steal a few minutes away or play one-handed while I hold my sleeping kid is such a joy.\n\n- I’m almost done playing through _Pokémon Crystal_ (well, technically [Polished Crystal](https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal)) in Delta and have published a couple [custom controller skins](https://deltastyles.com/user/92-andrewhaglund). Having a go-to game on your phone is a sure-fire way to stay off social media.\n- Played a little of _Hades 2_ in early access (it’s phenomenal) on my Steam Deck and am looking forward to diving in again.\n- I picked up _Paper Mario: Thousand Year Door_ remake for the Switch and have been slowly working my way through it. (For context I just stared Chapter 1.) I played the original a long time ago and have fond memories.\n\nI also [modded my Gamesir G8 controller](https://hachyderm.io/@haglund/112559467713943204) to work with my new iPad. It’s a glorious combination.\n\n## Music\nBeen enjoying new music from Vampire Weekend, Iron & Wine, Hovvdy, Decemberists, Billie Eilish, and of course Taylor Swift.\n\nLooking forward to new Bright Eyes and Coldplay in Q3. Speaking of Coldplay: I think they played [their best concert ever at Glastonbury](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kr82k58qqo). It was an incredibly special performance with a lot of heart. Knowing 100k people were there in-person seeing what I was seeing at the _exact save time_ was awe-inspiring. \n\n## Movies & TV\n- _Bad Batch_ (season 3) went out with a bang. Love a good star war.\n- _30 Rock_ (seasons 1–3) is sublime. To me it’s like a live-action cartoon and I am always here for the zaniness. Blink and you might miss three jokes. I just love Tracy Morgan, Jack McBrayer, and _everyone_ in the cast. (Some jokes haven’t aged well but that’s kind of how comedy works.) ★\n- My wife is rewatching _Modern Family_ and I’ll catch a few episodes here and there. Holy hell. That show deserve all its Emmys, it’s such a treat.\n- *Fargo* (season 3) was good but nothing like seasons 1 and 2 (which were _outstanding_). We watched an episode of season 4 and kinda bailed on it. I like _Fargo_ for the relatable characters — not the organized crime.\n- The last season of _Curb Your Enthusiasm_ (season 12) was fantastic. They nailed the finale. Pretty, _pretty_ good.\n- _Chernobyl_ (2019) was a rewatch for me. My wife never saw it and I was itching to rewatch it. It’s an amazing feat of film and one of the all-time greats.\n- _Demetri Martin: Demetri Deconstructed_ was humorous and surreal. Interesting editing and pacing of a live standup session.\n- _BlackBerry_ was excellent and such a funny and amazing “true story” movie. It makes you realize how far our current technology has come (and how amazing the iPhone is). I’d love to see Glenn Howerton in more serious roles going forward. ★\n- _Dream Scenario_ was a classic A24 film and Nic Cage was great. While I liked it I couldn’t help but think that I was just watching an extended version of the trailer. It’s all in there, weirdly enough.\n- _Conan O’Brien Must Go_ was a great laugh. Always been a fan of him and it’s fun seeing him have fun. ★\n- _Little Women_ (2019) was great. I’m not sure why we watched this now — it might have been suggested in Hulu or something — but it’s a delightful movie. I was in a stage adaptation of this in high school (I can’t remember who I played) so I’ll always have a soft spot for this tale. (It was also interesting watching this after seeing _Barbie_ since it was Gerwig’s previous project.)\n- _Castle in the Sky_ is a masterpiece. Watching this made me realize how much _Zelda_ borrows from Ghibli’s humor and style — everything from the nature, creatures, music, and floating cities were all just sitting there.\n- _Unfrosted_ felt like an odd halfway between a kid’s movie and something for older audience. Not sure who this movie was for…? Just a big sugar-high mess of cameos. (Jack McBrayer and the _Mad Men_ scene make it worthwhile in my book.) If this didn’t have Seinfeld attached there’s no way I would have watched it.\n- _Clueless_ (1995) I _think_ I had seen this once before but not sure. It was a fine romcom. Not sure how Paul Rudd still looks the same.\n\n---\nAs always I want to thank Shawn Hickman for making [Sofa](https://www.sofahq.com/). I use it to queue up media and log when I’ve watched/played it.\n",

				"title": "The Trials and Tribulations of Creating Delta Skins on iPadOS",
				"content_html": "<p>I decided to work on <a href=\"https://github.com/AndrewHaglund/delta-absorb\">Absorb</a>, my <a href=\"https://noah978.gitbook.io/delta-docs/skins\">custom Gameboy skin</a> for the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688\">Delta emulator</a>, from my shiny new 11-inch iPad Pro. There’s been a lot of conversation around what the iPad can and cannot do so I thought I’d give this a try. This is <em>fairly</em> complex work involving designing in Figma, editing JSON files, managing files, and committing code to GitHub. Let’s see how the experiment went.</p>\n<h2 id=\"figma\">Figma</h2>\n<p>Designing in Figma on iPadOS is a bit of a cluster. Their marketing claims it works great in “any browser” but apparently that generous definition does not extend to Safari for iPad. If you use it directly in the browser you get weird behavior. For example, pinching with your fingers will zoom the canvas where pinching on a trackpad will zoom the entire web page. There is <a href=\"https://figurative.design/\">Figurative</a> but this has its own tradeoffs: if I left and came back it would force reload the file because it was “out of memory” and irritatingly ⌘c and ⌘v don’t work. Generally it felt like wearing mittens — the iPadOS cursor is great but it still feels like a small meaty pointer and not the precise pointer you find on macOS.</p>\n<p>Critically dealing with custom fonts is a mess on iPadOS. <a href=\"https://blog.iconfactory.com/2020/06/introducing-fontcase/\">Fontcase</a> by the Iconfactory folks is great but it lives within Apple’s barbaric iPadOS font system. I used <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/fonts/\">SF Pro Rounded</a> for my button labels and I completely bailed on trying to get this onto iPad. Apple provides these fonts in a macOS Installer within a <code>.dmg</code> file, which is to decidedly <em>not</em> iPadOS-friendly. How does Figma handle missing fonts? Well by making text uneditable. Fun.</p>\n<p>Exporting PDFs out of Figma into the Files app worked great and I was able to get a lot of design work done from my iPad. It was slow-going and the font issue ultimately drove me back to the Mac.</p>\n<p>I have an itch to try making a Figma plugin to make it super easy to create Delta skins. That’s for another day though.</p>\n<h2 id=\"editing-json\">Editing JSON</h2>\n<p>Delta’s skin system is pretty straightforward. You provide PDFs of the UI your users will see and then give the coordinates of all the buttons in a JSON file. This mapping can get unwieldy though as each device and orientation is all within a single JSON file. (It would be kind of nice if each PDF had its own JSON to make these files way more manageable.)</p>\n<p>On the Mac and other desktop platforms there’s VS Code for code editing and committing code to GitHub. It’s fantastic. It has a great <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM4Vhrk4irY\">sticky scrolling</a> feature which means you don’t lose your context. Even still it can be a pain doing all this text entry and all too often I’d forget a <code>,</code> or a <code>:</code> and everything would break!</p>\n<p>VS Code is nowhere to be found on iPadOS and I could not find a text editor for iPad that had this sticky scrolling feature… but I ran into Simon Støvring’s <a href=\"https://jayson.app\">Jayson</a> (ha) app for editing JSON files with a GUI. This is far more approachable as you no longer need to think of the syntax for JSON and making a mistake. But it also involved a lot of navigating in-and-out due to the hierarchy of Delta’s skin system (where you have to drill into <code>dictionary 0</code> to see it’s the “A” button then back out to adjust its coordinates). Using this was better than typing manually, for sure, but I think there’s a lot of opportunity for Simon to optimize this app for fewer clicks and faster navigating up-and-down the hierarchy.</p>\n<p>This app is also available on macOS but it’s a bare-minimum Catalyst version of the iPad app. (Sorry if I sound negative! I’m glad it exists on macOS but this was a rare case where the superior experience was definitely on iPad.)</p>\n<p>This part of the process is a huge fun suck but that’s not the iPad’s fault.</p>\n<h2 id=\"managing-files\">Managing Files</h2>\n<p>Technically a Delta skin is just a renamed ZIP file of a JSON file and some PDFs. I downloaded a <a href=\"https://noah978.gitbook.io/delta-docs/skins\">template</a> to get started, exported my designs as PDFs from Figma to the Files app, edited the JSON file in Jayson, and was able to select the files, compress, and change the extension from <code>.zip</code> to <code>.deltaSkin</code>. Pretty easy. I didn’t have any issues with the Files app other than some slow exports from Figurative.</p>\n<h2 id=\"committing-code-to-github\">Committing Code to GitHub</h2>\n<p>I chose to host my files as an <a href=\"https://github.com/AndrewHaglund/delta-absorb\">open source project on GitHub</a>. The big asterisk here is that my Figma files are not <em>yet</em> public. While I’ll host these themes on Gumroad and <a href=\"https://deltastyles.com\">DeltaStyles</a> for discoverability I thought it was in the spirt of Delta emulator itself being <a href=\"https://github.com/rileytestut/Delta\">open source</a> that my files are “out there” for anyone.</p>\n<p>Doing all the file management of creating the skins (zipping, renaming, editing JSON, exporting PDFs) meant that I wanted a good git client. Turns out there is <a href=\"https://workingcopyapp.com\">Working Copy</a> by <a href=\"https://indieapps.space/@palmin@mastodon.social\">Anders Borum</a>! I happily paid $25. It stings a <em>little</em> knowing VS Code is free on macOS and it handles everything I need, but this Working Copy is a powerhouse. (I’ll be able to use this app for posting to my blog so it’s not just a one-time cost.)</p>\n<p>After committing changes on my iPad I was able to iteratively test and debug my new GBA skin on my iPhone by sending it over AirDrop, make changes on iPad, send over, commit my work, and so on until I got everything working just right.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>While I had to fallback to the Mac for the design part — partly due to wanting a bigger screen and iPadOS font limitations — I was able to do most of this work from my iPad.</p>\n<p>This is an exciting prospect as I tend to keep my MacBook Pro docked at my desk as a “desktop laptop.” This makes my iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard a perfect “around the house” machine. If I’m doing some online shopping I can leave the keyboard and just use this lovely big screen. If I want to get some serious work done or write a blog post from the back porch, I snap on the keyboard. If I want to plan some electrical upgrades and need to doodle a bit — I grab the Apple Pencil.</p>\n<p>It’s kind of an amazing device and it echoes the <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/modular-computer/\">modular computing idea</a> Federico is always going on about. (Next up is getting it to work with my Gamesir G8 controller. Currently I’m using this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZBRG92Z?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details\">90-degree female-to-male USB-C cable</a>.)</p>\n<p>I think my future experimentations might lie in building an app or something to automate the tedious JSON creation for Delta skins. Designing these is a lot of fun. Editing JSON is not.</p>\n<p>In summary here are my main complaints with iPadOS for this workflow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Figma is not good on iPadOS. I’m not sure if this is a Safari problem or Figma but it’s kind of a huge let down that it doesn’t work well — even with a mouse and keyboard.</li>\n<li>Apple’s own SF fonts are impossible to install from an iPad.</li>\n<li>It would be remarkable if VS Code came to iPad. It’s an amazing IDE. I’m glad Working Copy exists but this would be a big game changer.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Lastly: If you’re playing retro games on your iPhone as much as I am, take a look at my custom skin, <a href=\"https://github.com/AndrewHaglund/delta-absorb\">Absorb</a>, for Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance. They’re great for nighttime playing! Just download the <code>.deltaSkin</code> files and go into Delta’s settings to install.</p>\n",

Using this was better than typing manually, for sure, but I think there’s a lot of opportunity for Simon to optimize this app for fewer clicks and faster navigating up-and-down the hierarchy.\n\nThis app is also available on macOS but it’s a bare-minimum Catalyst version of the iPad app. (Sorry if I sound negative! I’m glad it exists on macOS but this was a rare case where the superior experience was definitely on iPad.)\n\nThis part of the process is a huge fun suck but that’s not the iPad’s fault.\n\n## Managing Files\nTechnically a Delta skin is just a renamed ZIP file of a JSON file and some PDFs. I downloaded a [template](https://noah978.gitbook.io/delta-docs/skins) to get started, exported my designs as PDFs from Figma to the Files app, edited the JSON file in Jayson, and was able to select the files, compress, and change the extension from `.zip` to `.deltaSkin`. Pretty easy. I didn’t have any issues with the Files app other than some slow exports from Figurative.\n\n## Committing Code to GitHub\nI chose to host my files as an [open source project on GitHub](https://github.com/AndrewHaglund/delta-absorb). The big asterisk here is that my Figma files are not *yet* public. While I’ll host these themes on Gumroad and [DeltaStyles](https://deltastyles.com) for discoverability I thought it was in the spirt of Delta emulator itself being [open source](https://github.com/rileytestut/Delta) that my files are “out there” for anyone.\n\nDoing all the file management of creating the skins (zipping, renaming, editing JSON, exporting PDFs) meant that I wanted a good git client. Turns out there is [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com) by [Anders Borum](https://indieapps.space/@palmin@mastodon.social)! I happily paid $25. It stings a *little* knowing VS Code is free on macOS and it handles everything I need, but this Working Copy is a powerhouse. (I’ll be able to use this app for posting to my blog so it’s not just a one-time cost.)\n\nAfter committing changes on my iPad I was able to iteratively test and debug my new GBA skin on my iPhone by sending it over AirDrop, make changes on iPad, send over, commit my work, and so on until I got everything working just right.\n\n## Conclusion\nWhile I had to fallback to the Mac for the design part — partly due to wanting a bigger screen and iPadOS font limitations — I was able to do most of this work from my iPad.\n\nThis is an exciting prospect as I tend to keep my MacBook Pro docked at my desk as a “desktop laptop.” This makes my iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard a perfect “around the house” machine. If I’m doing some online shopping I can leave the keyboard and just use this lovely big screen. If I want to get some serious work done or write a blog post from the back porch, I snap on the keyboard. If I want to plan some electrical upgrades and need to doodle a bit — I grab the Apple Pencil.\n\nIt’s kind of an amazing device and it echoes the [modular computing idea](https://www.macstories.net/stories/modular-computer/) Federico is always going on about. (Next up is getting it to work with my Gamesir G8 controller. Currently I’m using this [90-degree female-to-male USB-C cable](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZBRG92Z?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details).)\n\nI think my future experimentations might lie in building an app or something to automate the tedious JSON creation for Delta skins. Designing these is a lot of fun. Editing JSON is not.\n\nIn summary here are my main complaints with iPadOS for this workflow:\n\n- Figma is not good on iPadOS. I’m not sure if this is a Safari problem or Figma but it’s kind of a huge let down that it doesn’t work well — even with a mouse and keyboard.\n- Apple’s own SF fonts are impossible to install from an iPad.\n- It would be remarkable if VS Code came to iPad. It’s an amazing IDE. I’m glad Working Copy exists but this would be a big game changer.\n\n---\nLastly: If you’re playing retro games on your iPhone as much as I am, take a look at my custom skin, [Absorb](https://github.com/AndrewHaglund/delta-absorb), for Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance. They’re great for nighttime playing! Just download the `.deltaSkin` files and go into Delta’s settings to install.\n",

This part, however, got me worried about what precedent this case could set:\n\n> Is it illegal for Apple to use its power to improve the user experience? What about when it cuts itself in for some sweet Services revenue along the way?\n\nI design for a [big corporation](/2024/03/04/working-at-john.html) so I’m part of the *Big Scary Tech* this bill is targeting (therefore my perspective is biased). As I read more on the topic, my mind keeps wandering back to this doomsday of question: is Design — the art of making things with value, with quality, with utility — ultimately under attack?\n\n---\nWhile I disagree with some ideas in this lawsuit, I’m fascinated to see what happens.\n\nApple could stand to loosen up a bit, without losing much. Let apps run outside the App Store. Let people use the smartwatch of their choice. Let users use their godawful bank as an alternative wallet to Apple Pay. What we’ll all learn together is that the total package, the *design* of this ecosystem, is what customers pay for and *want*.\n\nIn other words: if Apple has to compete, I’m confident they’ll win.\n\n[^1]: Except Apple, naturally.\n",

I recall playing with vintage Macs in the school library in kindergarten or first-grade (circa 1996).

It showed how products can <em>delight</em>. I spent countless hours after school using my grandma’s iMac G5 to <del>do homework</del> play games.</p>\n<p>But it wasn’t until I had my own Mac that I fell in love. After a couple summers working for the high school alumni newsletter (produced with G3, G4, and G5 Power Macs) I saved up and bought a 12” iBook G4. Bonus: it came with a silver iPod mini. I curated a music collection and customized every aspect of it with <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20031206095326/http://www.panic.com/candybar/\">Candybar</a>. After running through multiple (and expensive) power cables and batteries, I made a massive jump to a white Intel MacBook.</p>\n<p>I used the hell out of that Mac. I learned Illustrator, Final Cut Pro, Garageband, Photoshop, and so many other tools that let me explore being creative. It was my portal to the internet and chatting with friends on <a href=\"https://www.adium.im\">Adium</a>. It’s where I amassed an astounding amount of <del>legally obtained</del> music and movies that shaped my taste.</p>\n<p>The Mac fits my brain in a way where I can create and work effortlessly. It’s always had a flourishing community of developers building utilities to extend platform. The flexibility and openness of the Mac is what makes it so special.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> From PowerPC to Intel then Intel to Apple Silicon I’ve seen huge leaps in what Mac are capable of. <em>The Mac Goes On</em> and I’ve enjoyed witnessing the evolution from Tiger to Sonoma.</p>\n<p>Here’s to 40 more.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>I want this post to celebrate what I love about the Mac.

I recall playing with vintage Macs in the school library in kindergarten or first-grade (circa 1996). I was blown away by the [iMac G4](https://www.macworld.com/article/218460/the-exceptional-imac-g4-ten-years-later.html) and it’s the reason I went into design. It showed how products can *delight*. I spent countless hours after school using my grandma’s iMac G5 to ~~do homework~~ play games.\n\nBut it wasn’t until I had my own Mac that I fell in love. After a couple summers working for the high school alumni newsletter (produced with G3, G4, and G5 Power Macs) I saved up and bought a 12” iBook G4. Bonus: it came with a silver iPod mini. I curated a music collection and customized every aspect of it with [Candybar](https://web.archive.org/web/20031206095326/http://www.panic.com/candybar/). After running through multiple (and expensive) power cables and batteries, I made a massive jump to a white Intel MacBook.\n\nI used the hell out of that Mac. I learned Illustrator, Final Cut Pro, Garageband, Photoshop, and so many other tools that let me explore being creative. It was my portal to the internet and chatting with friends on [Adium](https://www.adium.im). It’s where I amassed an astounding amount of ~~legally obtained~~ music and movies that shaped my taste.\n\nThe Mac fits my brain in a way where I can create and work effortlessly. It’s always had a flourishing community of developers building utilities to extend platform. The flexibility and openness of the Mac is what makes it so special.[^1] From PowerPC to Intel then Intel to Apple Silicon I’ve seen huge leaps in what Mac are capable of. _The Mac Goes On_ and I’ve enjoyed witnessing the evolution from Tiger to Sonoma.\n\nHere’s to 40 more.\n\n\n[^1]: I want this post to celebrate what I love about the Mac. These points on openness and flexibility highlight my, and governments around the world, frustrations with iOS, iPadOS, and (soon to be) visionOS. These systems are closed off and I think it does a lot more harm than good.\n",

Reflecting on the year was a fun process and I hope to turn this into an annual tradition.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tech-stories\">Tech Stories</h2>\n<p>There were a lot of disastrous tech stories this year but <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/23andme-credential-stuffing-data-stolen/\">23andMe’s data breach</a> has a special spot in my heart. When I think about the implications for how this data could be misused (off the dome: planting false evidence at a crime scene, the inevitability of nonconsensual cloning), I have a hard time racking my brain for data that’s more sensitive. Stories like this <em>should</em> remind us to be more thoughtful of what we put online. Based on what I see on LinkedIn (a “professional” network), society has ways to go.</p>\n<p>Other stories that spring to mind are <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/gm-justifies-decision-to-ditch-apple-carplay-due-to-stability-issues/\">GM’s bone-headed decision to drop CarPlay</a> and the spectacular bungled effort to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23981848/sam-altman-back-open-ai-ceo-microsoft-board\">fire Sam Altman</a>. The world came <em>this close</em> to Microsoft hiring every employee from OpenAI.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Speaking of close calls: <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-adobe-abandon-proposed-merger/\">Adobe almost acquired Figma</a>. I’m bummed for the Figma employees (who missed out on a big windfall) but this is probably for the best.</p>\n<p>We saw the <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/12/31/elon-musks-x-fidelity-valuation-cut\">collapse of Twitter</a>, which was bound to happen, but did anyone think it’d deteriorate this quickly? In its wake we saw the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/10/23787453/meta-instagram-threads-100-million-users-milestone\">meteoric launch of Threads</a> and <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/\">Mastodon’s</a> slow-and-steady growth. I hope smaller services like <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">Micro.blog</a> are getting their day in the sun.

In September I launched my first app, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833\">MapKeep</a>.</p>\n<p>I noodled around with an app for Merlin Mann’s <a href=\"https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom/blob/master/wisdom.md\">Wisdom Project</a> and a packing/shopping list app based on Myke Hurley’s request in <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/489\">Upgrade 489</a>). These projects are on-hold for now.</p>\n<p>Weebly hosted my personal site for 10 years but I grew tired of its outdated editor and <em>godawful</em> blogging tools. I used this as an excuse to learn HTML/CSS and rebuilt my site from scratch. At the end of December the site was rebuilt again using <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev\">Eleventy</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"travel\">Travel</h2>\n<p>I visited Des Moines, IA, for a week every quarter for “in-person week” at work. My brother happened to live there which meant we could get dinner downtown or watch an episode of <em>The Sopranos</em> at his apartment. Those days are behind us now that he’s moved to Chicago. It reminds me to always take advantage of opportunities to see family.</p>\n<p>I went to Florida to visit sugar cane growers in February. The area was recovering from <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/us/hurricane-ian-fort-myers-beach-florida/index.html\">Hurricane Ian</a> and the destruction was awful. Fort Myers Beach was on a boil order. The hotel was underwater days before I checked-in. I spent a few hours walking the beach and marveled at collapsed hotels, restaurants, and homes.</p>\n<p>In May we went to Michigan for a high-school friend’s wedding. A week later we went to a cousin’s high school graduation in Denver and we hiked at <a href=\"https://www.jeffco.us/1332/Mount-Falcon-Park\">Mount Falcon Park</a>.</p>\n<p>As an annual tradition we spent a week with my in-laws in Madison, WI, in June visiting downtown, breweries, and the <a href=\"https://union.wisc.edu/visit/terrace-at-the-memorial-union/\">UW Union Terrace</a>. In August we made a trip to Missouri for our niece’s 2nd birthday.</p>\n<p>At the end of September a close friend and college roommate got married in the Virginia/DC area.

				"content_text": "\n## Preamble\nMy goal is to collect the stories and art I experienced in 2023 with a sprinkle of personal updates. Reflecting on the year was a fun process and I hope to turn this into an annual tradition.\n\n## Tech Stories\nThere were a lot of disastrous tech stories this year but [23andMe’s data breach](https://www.wired.com/story/23andme-credential-stuffing-data-stolen/) has a special spot in my heart. When I think about the implications for how this data could be misused (off the dome: planting false evidence at a crime scene, the inevitability of nonconsensual cloning), I have a hard time racking my brain for data that’s more sensitive. Stories like this *should* remind us to be more thoughtful of what we put online. Based on what I see on LinkedIn (a “professional” network), society has ways to go.\n\nOther stories that spring to mind are [GM’s bone-headed decision to drop CarPlay](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/gm-justifies-decision-to-ditch-apple-carplay-due-to-stability-issues/) and the spectacular bungled effort to [fire Sam Altman](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23981848/sam-altman-back-open-ai-ceo-microsoft-board). The world came *this close* to Microsoft hiring every employee from OpenAI.[^1]\n\nSpeaking of close calls: [Adobe almost acquired Figma](https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-adobe-abandon-proposed-merger/). I’m bummed for the Figma employees (who missed out on a big windfall) but this is probably for the best.\n\nWe saw the [collapse of Twitter](https://www.axios.com/2023/12/31/elon-musks-x-fidelity-valuation-cut), which was bound to happen, but did anyone think it’d deteriorate this quickly? In its wake we saw the [meteoric launch of Threads](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/10/23787453/meta-instagram-threads-100-million-users-milestone) and [Mastodon’s](https://joinmastodon.org/) slow-and-steady growth. I hope smaller services like [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) are getting their day in the sun. In 2024 and beyond I’m ready for a [weirder internet](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-commentary/internet-future-about-to-get-weird-1234938403/).\n\nIt’s for these reasons I’m starting a blog.[^2] After years of posting to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrewhaglund) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/andrewhaglund/), it’s time to have a proper home on the web. I’ve settled on:\n- Short, frequent posts on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@haglund)\n- Long, infrequent posts here ([subscribe via RSS](/feed.xml))\n\n## The Year of Development\nI prefer [Yearly Themes](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/150) over resolutions and while I didn’t plan a theme for 2023, reflecting on the past year helped a theme emerge retroactively: *the Year of Development*.\n\nAfter the initial excitement of the [Vision Pro unveiling at WWDC](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/wwdc23-highlights/) I spent many summer nights and weekends learning SwiftUI and SwiftData. In September I launched my first app, [MapKeep](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833).\n\nI noodled around with an app for Merlin Mann’s [Wisdom Project](https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom/blob/master/wisdom.md) and a packing/shopping list app based on Myke Hurley’s request in [Upgrade 489](https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/489)). These projects are on-hold for now.\n\nWeebly hosted my personal site for 10 years but I grew tired of its outdated editor and *godawful* blogging tools. I used this as an excuse to learn HTML/CSS and rebuilt my site from scratch. At the end of December the site was rebuilt again using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev).\n\n## Travel\nI visited Des Moines, IA, for a week every quarter for “in-person week” at work. My brother happened to live there which meant we could get dinner downtown or watch an episode of *The Sopranos* at his apartment. Those days are behind us now that he’s moved to Chicago. It reminds me to always take advantage of opportunities to see family.\n\nI went to Florida to visit sugar cane growers in February. The area was recovering from [Hurricane Ian](https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/us/hurricane-ian-fort-myers-beach-florida/index.html) and the destruction was awful. Fort Myers Beach was on a boil order. The hotel was underwater days before I checked-in. I spent a few hours walking the beach and marveled at collapsed hotels, restaurants, and homes.\n\nIn May we went to Michigan for a high-school friend’s wedding. A week later we went to a cousin’s high school graduation in Denver and we hiked at [Mount Falcon Park](https://www.jeffco.us/1332/Mount-Falcon-Park).\n\nAs an annual tradition we spent a week with my in-laws in Madison, WI, in June visiting downtown, breweries, and the [UW Union Terrace](https://union.wisc.edu/visit/terrace-at-the-memorial-union/). In August we made a trip to Missouri for our niece’s 2nd birthday.\n\nAt the end of September a close friend and college roommate got married in the Virginia/DC area. We had great time reminiscing over our stupidity in college.\n\n## Work\nI continue to work for John Deere as a UX Lead and love it. I was recently promoted and my area of responsibly has grown and I now directly manage a few designers. I’m adjusting to the new role and I’ll be reading *[The First 90 Days](https://hbr.org/books/watkins)* ASAP.\n\nI’m fortunate to have a [great mentor and manager](https://inkypixelsdesign.com). This was a tough year for layoffs across a lot of industries and I don’t take my position for granted.\n\nI try to stay connected with the University of Illinois and in March I gave a talk about the design process at the [Siebel Center of Design](https://designcenter.illinois.edu/).\n\n---\n\n## Games\nI’m approaching the end of the main storyline in *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom* and … what a masterpiece. *Mario Wonder* was a blast! 2023 was [filled with amazing games](https://intothecast.transistor.fm/episodes/the-2023-game-of-the-year-spectacular) and I expect my [OLED Steam Deck](https://www.steamdeck.com/oled) can help expose me to more non-Nintendo games in 2024.\n\nI’ve been playing retro games:\n- *Pokémon Red* ([Anniversary romhack](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/2362/)) and *Tetris* on my silver [Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket).\n- The [PC port](https://www.shipofharkinian.com) of *Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time* on the Mac.\n- *Super Mario World*, naturally.\n\nThis Christmas the [Genki dock](https://www.genkithings.com/products/covert-dock-2) let my cousins and I (ranging from ages 12 to 32) play local co-op with 6-players in *Super Smash Bros*. Chaotic joy.\n\n## Podcasts\nI heard the podcast ad market was tough in 2023. Hosts would mention this occasionally and I noticed fewer (or zero) ads. I decided to open [my wallet](https://bellroy.com/products/card-sleeve-wallet?color=hazelnut&material=leather&size=default) and financially support the work I love:\n\n- *[Accidental Tech Podcast](https://atp.fm/)*: Exceptionally consistent. Gotta support John now that [he’s gone indie](https://hypercritical.co/2022/03/30/independence-day).\n- *[Into the Aether](https://intothecast.online)*: I have a tremendous appreciation for the art of video game creation thanks to Brendon and Stephen.\n- *[Roderick on the Line](http://www.merlinmann.com/Roderick/)*: I’ve been listening to the internet’s Merlin Mann and the Long Winters’ John Roderick for a *long time*.\n- *[Upgrade](https://www.relay.fm/upgrade)*: Myke and Jason’s segments on Apple and the entertainment industry keep me coming back week after week.\n\nI loved [Sir McCartney’s show](https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/mccartney-a-life-in-lyrics) where he tells the stories behind his killer songs.[^3]\n\nIn 2024 I want to reduce my podcast intake or introduce more variety. It’s too easy for me to pop-in an AirPod and tune-out the world. I’m not giving myself enough time for silence.\n\n## Music\nThanks to Apple Music’s awkward [Replay](https://replay.music.apple.com/) feature I have a list of most-listened music from 2023:\n\n- *[the record](https://boygenius.lnk.to/therecord)* by boygenius\n- *[GUTS](https://oliviarodrigo.lnk.to/GUTS)* by Olivia Rodrigo\n- *[Fantasy](https://m83.lnk.to/fantasy)* by M83\n- *[WE](https://af.lnk.to/_WEAW)* by Arcade Fire (2022)\n- *[Multitudes](https://interscope.lnk.to/Multitudes)* by Feist\n- *[Asphalt Meadows (Acoustic)](https://death-cab-for-cutie.lnk.to/AMAcoustic)* by Death Cab for Cutie\n- *[The Land Is Hospitable and So Are We](https://mitski.lnk.to/TLIIASAW)* by Mitski\n- *[Oppenheimer](https://music.apple.com/us/album/oppenheimer-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1697599270)* by Ludwig Göransson\n- *[Random Access Memories](https://daftpunk.lnk.to/RAM_Originals)* by Daft Punk (2013) is routinely played on Friday afternoons as work winds down. (I will **not** link to the drumless abomination.)\n\nOther music highlights:\n- I started digging into Peter Gabriel’s *[i/o](https://lnk.to/PG21)*. There are 3 mixes of the album which is fascinating. I can’t explain it but the acoustic guitar in the opening track *Panopticom* fills me with joy.\n- Sufjan Stevens’ *[Javelin](https://sufjanstevens.lnk.to/javelin)* was lovely but I haven’t listened to it enough.\n- I recorded a short composition called [*A Quiet Night*](https://soundcloud.com/andrewhaglund/a-quiet-night).\n- As part of a Christmas gift I introduced my brother to some chords on the guitar.\n- My hopes are high for Michael Stipe’s [first post-R.E.M. album](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/03/magazine/michael-stipe-solo-album.html) (I first heard it teased on [Smartless](https://www.smartless.com/episodes/episode/24585bee/michael-stipe)). The [*Up* remaster](https://found.ee/rem-up25) was impeccable.\n\nLive shows:\n- [Rodrigo y Gabriela](https://www.rodgab.com) at Krannert’s [Ellnora](https://krannertcenter.com/ellnora) festival. They’re gods. (Thanks to Señora Kooy, my high school Spanish teacher, who originally introduced me to this duo.)\n- [Lauren Mayberry](https://laurenmayberry.co.uk) of Churches at the Rose Bowl. I missed seeing her opener, [Claud](https://toastmp3.bandcamp.com/album/supermodels) whose record is a gift to humanity.\n- YouTube concerts don’t count but my brother was at a very similar show to [Bon Iver at Pitchfork](https://youtu.be/TolZh65YsmM?si=mGJnauI28TmKEXYv).\n\nOne last note: we all heard a new Beatles song this year. Its authenticity is contentious but seeing [people singing *Now and Then* in Central Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzcsKb8iLY&pp=ygUZbm93IGFuZCB0aGVuIGNlbnRyYWwgcGFyaw%3D%3D) is something. It’s hard to imagine this song hasn’t been around for 50 years.\n\n## Reading\nI started supporting [kottke.org](https://kottke.org) by becoming a [member](https://kottke.org/members). His site is an invaluable source of information on the internet across a variety of topics and help satiates my curiosity.\n\nI read *[Expecting Better](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/310896/expecting-better-by-emily-oster/)* which is the *Freakonomics* of pregnancy.\n\n30 seconds into Apple’s trailer for [*Silo*](https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2023/06/apple-tv-renews-hit-world-building-drama-silo-for-season-two/) and I was hooked. Before the show aired I read the first book, *[Wool](https://hughhowey.com/books/wool/)*. I’m currently reading *[Shift](https://hughhowey.com/books/shift/)*, book 2 of 3. If you’re a fan of the show, read the books.\n\n(I *think* I read more than this but I don’t have a good tracking system.)\n\n\n## Movies\nThroughout the year I used [Sofa](https://www.sofahq.com) to track what I watched. Stars indicate favorites ★.\n\n- Dec: Barbie ★\n- Dec: Knocked Up (rewatch)\n- Dec: National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (rewatch)\n- Dec: Godzilla Minus One ★\n- Nov: A Charlie Brown Christmas (rewatch)\n- Nov: David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived\n- Oct: Young Frankenstein (rewatch)\n- Oct: Flora and Son\n- Oct: The Swan\n- Oct: You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah\n- Oct: Flight of the Conchords: Live in London (rewatch)\n- Oct: The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar\n- Sep: Elemental\n- Sep: Death on the Nile\n- Sep: John Mulaney: Baby J\n- Sep: Air\n- Aug: Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse ★\n- Aug: Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood\n- Aug: The Beanie Bubble\n- Jul: Oppenheimer ★\n- Apr: The Super Mario Bros.
