				"title": "The State of UI Design in 2025",
				"content_html": "<p>The new design of iOS and macOS 26 this summer has been controversial to say the least. To my eyes the glass effects do, in fact, look cool. But many aspects of the design make no logical sense. Apple’s obsession with “getting the UI out of the way of your content” is absurd and when you look at how they <em>executed</em> on this idea, it’s clear they didn’t achieve that goal: The new UI is more distracting, less predictable, less stable, and less readable than ever before.</p>\n<p>I’ve been using Apple’s new design language on my iPad and Mac, following the discourse and reception to it, and it has me thinking about the design industry as a whole. Apple’s reputation looms large in the design world. Many designers look up to Apple. We look to them for guidance to define what it means to make “a good app.” My concern at the moment: if Apple has lost its way, will the world of design blindly follow, or will they think critically and assess if Apple’s vision and direction is any good?</p>\n<p>There is certainly a level of craft and quality achieved within Liquid Glass, some (but <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@marcoarment/114927268189889547\">not all</a>) of the transitions and effects are kind of mesmerizing. Underlying this layer of unusable glass is seemingly <em>nothing</em>. There used to be a solid foundation of human-computer interaction principles that <em>sat beneath</em> the visual quality of the design from Apple. In fact, they were trailblazers and founding-members of this discipline. The Apple designers of the past understood the importance of contrast, differentiating controls, and studying how users thought and felt about their interfaces by studying their behavior. It’s clear that this approach to design is no longer in power at Apple.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I consider <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2025/07/31/ep-428\">Episode 428 of <em>The Talk Show</em></a> to be required listening if you design or build software. There are too many quotes to pull from but trust me, just listen to all (3 hours) of it. <a href=\"https://lmnt.me/\">Louie Mantia</a> is the guest and I have the utmost admiration and respect for his taste and <a href=\"https://parakeet.co/\">work</a>. His recent blog post, <a href=\"https://lmnt.me/blog/a-responsibility-to-the-industry.html\">A Responsibility to the Industry</a>, covers many of the same points I’m making here. It was this post (and others) that sparked John Gruber to invite Louie onto the show.</p>\n<p>The conversation revolves around the new operating systems featuring Liquid Glass. One thing that struck me is how design has shifted over time to say <em>UX</em> (or user experience) as opposed to <em>UI</em> (or user interface). This episode talks about the “how it works” of software design but it also covers a ton about how it “looks and feels”. You could argue Apple’s new design language over-prioritizes “looks and feel” and leaves behind the “how it works.”</p>\n<p>In 2025 I feel too much of the design industry has lost the attention to detail and focus on the “look and feel” of software. Over the past 10-15 years UX practitioners have had to beg and claw to get a seat at the table at companies. We’ve had to prove and argue what a good experience is worth. This absolutely helped grow our industry and bring design thinking into many more organizations.</p>\n<p>As part of this transition to power, however, we’ve too often cozied-up to the “suits” to ensure we’re delivering <em>value</em> and we’ve pitched ourselves as “we’re not <em>just</em> UI designers, we think about the entire user experience”. While this sounds good, the issue is that it implies that making nice interfaces is <strong>not valuable</strong> in-and-of itself. This is false! Think of <em>slide to unlock</em> from the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKMoT-6XSg\">original iPhone</a> debut. Here&rsquo;s Louie around 2 hr 14 min:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The first interaction we had with iPhone was slide to unlock. [Jobs] did it twice because everyone was <em>so</em> into it. There is an important part of making things make sense, making them joyful. There’s delightful thing because if you don&rsquo;t have that, then the entire system looks like something you don&rsquo;t want to touch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course software needs to solve a problem. I think Tony Fadell captures this well with his <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/graham-winfrey/nest-tony-fadell-on-bringing-innovation-to-market.html\">“make painkillers, not vitamins”</a> quip, but we’ve lost a lot of <strong>craft and appreciation</strong> for making great interfaces that work well and feel amazing.</p>\n<p>It needs to be both. We need to help solve customer problems <strong>and</strong> we need to make the interactions wonderful. We’ve <em>discredited</em> and <em>downplayed</em> visual design but that’s the actual thing customers touch and click! In the name of getting a seat at the table we threw away the art of making apps look and feel <strong>great</strong>.</p>\n<p>There must be a better balance.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I’ve pulled a few quotes from <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2025/07/31/ep-428\">the episode</a>. Here’s around 1 hr 50 min:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>John Gruber: I had a friend who, recently-ish, ex-Apple, he had been there doing design work for 15 plus 20 years? I don&rsquo;t know, but he left somewhat recently, and he watched [<a href=\"https://youtu.be/dHrVGk0WwYM?t=381\">the Aqua introduction video</a>]… and said, “I forgot that Steve talked like that about using UI design lingo, like <em>key window</em> and <em>input focus</em> and things like that.” He said to me that he had meetings with Alan Dye&rsquo;s team in recent-ish years and that he’d used terms like that. And he said, “I never got cut off, but there was always an underlying tone of <em>shut up with the UI nerd stuff</em>.” That they didn&rsquo;t use terms like that, and that when describing an idea, that their eyes would roll back in their head, “Here goes another one of these key-window input-focus guys again.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, they’re the fucking team that shipped an iPad multi-window interface for 7 years where you couldn&rsquo;t tell which half of the screen was active.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Louie Mantia: You and I have talked about this before, this exact thing like years ago, but we <strong>solved that problem</strong> like over a decade ago. Why are we doing this right now where we are backtracking on the things that we already know to be true? I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t really make any sense to me why it’s hard to distinguish the inactive window.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There’s <em>so much</em> in this episode. This snippet in particular highlights that there’s a disdain for making interfaces usable within Apple. I’m not sure it’s even their third or fifth priority. I worry it’s <em>not even on their list</em>.</p>\n<p>John Gruber also had the opportunity to ask Alan Dye years ago about how Apple Watch handled overlapping hour, minute, and second hands on analog watch faces:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every physical watch with analog hands, the hands are stacked in the same order: where the hour hand is on the bottom, the minute hand is on top of the hour hand, and if there&rsquo;s a second hand, it&rsquo;s on top of the minute hand so that the hours, minutes, seconds are going forward.</p>\n<p>An Apple Watch renders the hands in the same Z-axis order. It’s not perfectly flat. And they render a sort of shadow around things so that you could see like when the minute hand is slightly overlapping…</p>\n<p>I had a question about the light source for the shadow, and I was like, <em>oh finally</em>, I get to ask Alan Dye about this.</p>\n<p>And he was like, “Oh, we render a shadow?”</p>\n<p>I just instantly realized: you’d never really even looked at it that closely. Like <em>somebody</em> at Apple has, but Alan Dye didn’t… I just remember thinking at that very moment, it just suddenly came to me, “oh, he doesn&rsquo;t do what I thought he did.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Related, a bit later (around the 2 hr 31 min mark) from Louie:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Steve] had a level of familiarity with [details]. I don&rsquo;t just know this because <em>my team</em> worked on it. I know it because I use it every day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At first blush, it may seem unfair to criticize a VP at a multi-trillion-dollar corporation with this sort of minutia. But this is the <em>watch face</em> of the Apple Watch. (It’s not some <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@siracusa/114898428763571700\">obscure macOS system settings screen</a> where the default system colors have now changed and now it’s impossible to distinguish which item is selected.) As someone who uses an Apple Watch <strong>I</strong> have personally seen this shadow. Once or twice in the 10 years of wearing this dang computer on my wrist I’ve looked down at my wrist and it’s been 1:05, 2:10 or 3:15, and so on. If you have an Apple Watch, you, (yes, even you dear reader!) probably have seen this shadow too.</p>\n<p>It’s like Alan Dye has never used the computers his teams are responsible for designing.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There’s a great segment about John’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbrfsXYoyCI&amp;pp=ygUUYXV0ZWFyIGRlaXNnbiBncnViZXI%3D\">Auteur Theory of Design</a> where he talks about how authorship differs between books (Mark Twain’s <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>), film (Steven Spielberg’s <em>Jaws</em>), and software (an app, and operating system, etc) as the number of people involved increases:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>John Gruber: My conclusion was that the level of quality of the work of a company, whether it’s hardware or software or something in between, eventually rises or falls to the level of taste of the person who’s <em>ultimately in charge</em> of it and gets to say yes or no. And I think we’re seeing Apple&rsquo;s UI design, not the styling, which is a separate issue, but the quality of the semantic design of the user interface, sort of fall apart because like you said, I don&rsquo;t know that there is person. It’s like trying to make a movie without a director.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Louie Mantia: I think all of these people can collectively say, “this is their app”, or “this is their OS that they worked on,” that they are the author. I think everyone who works on this stuff is entitled to say that they made it — unequivocally. But there has to be this person and that <strong>everyone’s meeting that vision</strong>. And I&rsquo;ve used the word “vision” to describe this thing like directorial stuff. There is someone&rsquo;s vision that they have and when it meets that, that’s when we’re shipping.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>There’s a great analogy of a costume designer for a Wes Anderson movie. That person (likely) doesn’t dress like a Wes Anderson character every day in real life. But when they to work on a Wes Anderson movie, they know what’s <em>expected of them</em> and they rise to that bar and adjust their taste. They know the assignment.</p>\n<p>From Louie Mantia, around 2 hr 32 min:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My question that I’ve had is, why does [Alan Dye] have this job? Why is he the person that does it?</p>\n<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t think Wes Anderson makes the best movies, I think we have to agree, he is the definition of that auteur — one-million percent that kind of person — so you have this clear vision and everyone is in service of that. You see it in the people that are the cinematographers, you see it in the people that are the actors that he chooses, everyone there is fully committed to the vision and I think that was true when Steve was there.</p>\n<p>Everyone, and I’ve talked with friends at Apple that have been there, that used to work there, people I used to work with, everyone agrees about this: Everyone was happy to let go of their own personal idea of how things should be in service of the <strong>vision</strong> that Steve generally had. Yes we were still making all these individual decisions. Yes we were still deciding how, but we were all in the back of our minds, “like what is the thing that we are guiding towards?” and it was always toward the vision that Steve.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When I rejoined John Deere a couple years ago we were going through a transformation (following the <a href=\"https://www.svpg.com/\">Silicon Valley Product Group</a> model). We had someone whose title literally has “director” in it who started establishing large reviews for upcoming features with a few goals: increase awareness across the organization, break down silo walls, improve collaboration, and raise the quality bar. This person would attend these reviews and provide honest (and fair!) feedback. Quite often their critique was not that the designs “weren’t good”, but that the team hadn’t considered all the various parts of our ecosystem and failed to loop-in teams should have been looped-in.</p>\n<p>This person’s goal was to <strong>elevate the quality</strong> of the entire organization. This level of scrutiny and attention to detail meant that everyone started <em>thinking differently</em>. We all started thinking, “we better do a good job on this and think end-to-end because we know we’ll get that feedback from you-know-who.” Over the years I’ve noticed this director’s presence a bit less in these reviews (except for big things) but the process and practice changes have remained. We know that this person <em>could</em> show up and we all strive to do better work because of it.</p>\n<p>That’s what I think about when I hear about Gruber and Louie talk about <strong>vision</strong> and improving quality. We have to aspire and reach to make things of high quality. It doesn’t happen just by hiring talented people, you have to push a bit.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Around 2 hr 40 min:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Gruber:</em> [Talking about Aqua] The language of that era of Apple design encompassed that range that Steve Jobs set out to cover from novice to pro.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Louie:</em> The style of Aqua was so adaptable and that’s what made it work. Those productivity tools (Final Cut, Logic) didn’t ignore Aqua. They acknowledged Aqua. They understood what it was trying to do. They adapted it to their product. Aperture was entirely graphic, right? Even GarageBand was super playful, right? GarageBand had wood on the side of the thing but it took away almost no screen real estate… but it puts you in a mood. It puts a visual clarity on what <em>this</em> app is versus what this <em>other</em> app is. At no point did it look like it was not part of the same system. There was a <strong>visual richness</strong> to Aqua that was like: so the system looks like <em>this</em>. Even if we have buttons that are rich Corinthian leather, even if we have buttons that are wood, right? Even if we have these other materials, they need to match this level of quality, of this visual quality that [Aqua] has.</p>\n<p>Everyone is working on this movie, right? Everyone sees what the direction is and everyone’s like, okay, so in the “Aqua Cinematic Universe”, there&rsquo;s actually more room for it than just Aqua, right? And that was true on iOS too. Early iOS stuff, when it was iPhoneOS: iPhone OS had all of these different kinds of material qualities to it where any app could do whatever we wanted, especially because it was taking up the full screen at the time. You could do anything and it was <em>not</em> incongruous with the system. As long as you acknowledged what the system was trying to do, then you could play with a little bit.</p>\n<p>Can you do that with Liquid Glass? Because it feels to me that if it doesn’t look like Liquid Glass, then it looks wrong on the platform, right? There&rsquo;s no alternative quality. There’s no alternative material to use. It’s not like you can suddenly use paper, but make it looks like it belongs in the “Liquid Glass Cinematic Universe.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Gruber:</em> And that’s why I&rsquo;m so disappointed overall with the big new UI [redesign]. We didn&rsquo;t even know what it was supposed to look like, but there were rumors for the last year that Apple’s doing a big platforms-spanning UI redesign and that it’s going to add some kind of texture and glass and something. I was so hopeful that it would bring back some of that era. Some of that tactical quality, some of that richness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There’s a lot to unpack here and I just loved this segment.</p>\n<p>After some time with macOS Tahoe, I find myself getting lost at glance in a sea of sameness. As an industry we’ve been chasing down <em>consistency</em> and <em>design systems</em> for basically forever. Familiarity has amazing qualities. It means you can learn one piece of software and have that translate across the system. (For example: once you learn system features like the macOS menu bar or <em>Customize Toolbar</em>, all your apps open up to you. To borrow an old Cocoa/AppKit analogy: you’re starting on the third floor instead of the basement.)</p>\n<p>This <em>sea of sameness</em> across macOS presents itself: every window is expanse of white with glass buttons (with terrible toolbar gradient shadows). Nothing is visually identifiable at a glance.</p>\n<p>From John Gruber, around 21 min:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But say what you want about the [stitched leather]. “Oh, I like the way that looks” or “I like the gimmick” of the way it looks. It undeniably made the Calendar window instantly recognizable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not only is there very little character left in these apps they’re <em>overly</em> same-y and harder to differentiate when using the system as a whole.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>On platform familiarity, here’s around 2 hr 20 min:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>John:</em> Xcode is a pretty good example of standard good Apple Mac UI design. And I know that you [random developer] have been using it for years because you’ve been making iOS apps for years. But somehow you&rsquo;ve been using Xcode and not paying <em>any</em> attention whatsoever to the interface?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Louie:</em> I’m not saying this is the cause, but I do wonder, over the years with the iOS-ification of a bunch of things and with iOS becoming like a more dominant platform in everyone’s hands, there’s also been simultaneously a decrease in macOS. … A lot of people use Safari as an interface for web apps that they use <em>a lot</em> more. Some people’s docks look like Finder, Safari, Trash. And you&rsquo;re like, “what? I can&rsquo;t even imagine it.” But that is how some people live.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I do have hope for the future. My suggestion to all designers, whether you work at Apple or anywhere else, is to take some time to understand the <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/books/tog-on-interface/\">underlying foundations</a> of what makes the Mac great. I worry designers who sit in front of a Mac 8 hours a day don’t understand just how great it is <em>beneath the surface</em> (how menus work, how keyboard navigation works, etc) and are content with throwing a design over the wall to their developers.</p>\n<p>As a result you’re only thinking surface-level about your designs, putting together LEGO-pieces from your design system and that’s about it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Before I sign off for this post, I also want to direct your attention to a complimentary podcast episode:</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://atp.fm/650\">ATP 650</a> John Siracusa talks about how UI design is a <strong>science</strong> and an <strong>art</strong>. It has to be both. How well does this design <em>perform</em> (science) and how does it make people <em>feel</em> (art). Siracusa’s argument is that the balance is completely out of whack at Apple. You have Alan Dye in charge of interface design, influencing how the entire world of <em>millions of designers</em> think about UI and it’s clear he is completely unqualified to do the job:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Alan Dye, who apparently comes from like a MarCom background, which is marketing, communication, like in print design, doesn&rsquo;t even have a background in user interface design…</p>\n<p>But I assure you, user interface design still is a field of study, at least in the academic world, where people try to make interfaces more usable to people by using <strong>reason</strong> and <strong>testing things</strong> and not just having a whim and deciding I want stitched leather because I think it’s cool and reminds me of seat backs on my private jet (or whatever the heck the story behind that was…)</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s an important part of it, but there has to be a balance.

				"content_text": "The new design of iOS and macOS 26 this summer has been controversial to say the least. To my eyes the glass effects do, in fact, look cool. But many aspects of the design make no logical sense. Apple’s obsession with “getting the UI out of the way of your content” is absurd and when you look at how they *executed* on this idea, it’s clear they didn’t achieve that goal: The new UI is more distracting, less predictable, less stable, and less readable than ever before.\n\nI’ve been using Apple’s new design language on my iPad and Mac, following the discourse and reception to it, and it has me thinking about the design industry as a whole. Apple’s reputation looms large in the design world. Many designers look up to Apple. We look to them for guidance to define what it means to make “a good app.” My concern at the moment: if Apple has lost its way, will the world of design blindly follow, or will they think critically and assess if Apple’s vision and direction is any good?\n\nThere is certainly a level of craft and quality achieved within Liquid Glass, some (but [not all](https://mastodon.social/@marcoarment/114927268189889547)) of the transitions and effects are kind of mesmerizing. Underlying this layer of unusable glass is seemingly *nothing*. There used to be a solid foundation of human-computer interaction principles that *sat beneath* the visual quality of the design from Apple. In fact, they were trailblazers and founding-members of this discipline. The Apple designers of the past understood the importance of contrast, differentiating controls, and studying how users thought and felt about their interfaces by studying their behavior. It’s clear that this approach to design is no longer in power at Apple. \n\n---\n\nI consider [Episode 428 of *The Talk Show*](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2025/07/31/ep-428) to be required listening if you design or build software. There are too many quotes to pull from but trust me, just listen to all (3 hours) of it. [Louie Mantia](https://lmnt.me/) is the guest and I have the utmost admiration and respect for his taste and [work](https://parakeet.co/). His recent blog post, [A Responsibility to the Industry](https://lmnt.me/blog/a-responsibility-to-the-industry.html), covers many of the same points I’m making here. It was this post (and others) that sparked John Gruber to invite Louie onto the show.\n\nThe conversation revolves around the new operating systems featuring Liquid Glass. One thing that struck me is how design has shifted over time to say *UX* (or user experience) as opposed to *UI* (or user interface). This episode talks about the “how it works” of software design but it also covers a ton about how it “looks and feels”. You could argue Apple’s new design language over-prioritizes “looks and feel” and leaves behind the “how it works.”\n\nIn 2025 I feel too much of the design industry has lost the attention to detail and focus on the “look and feel” of software. Over the past 10-15 years UX practitioners have had to beg and claw to get a seat at the table at companies. We’ve had to prove and argue what a good experience is worth. This absolutely helped grow our industry and bring design thinking into many more organizations.\n\nAs part of this transition to power, however, we’ve too often cozied-up to the “suits” to ensure we’re delivering *value* and we’ve pitched ourselves as “we’re not *just* UI designers, we think about the entire user experience”. While this sounds good, the issue is that it implies that making nice interfaces is **not valuable** in-and-of itself. This is false! Think of _slide to unlock_ from the [original iPhone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKMoT-6XSg) debut. Here's Louie around 2 hr 14 min:\n\n> The first interaction we had with iPhone was slide to unlock. [Jobs] did it twice because everyone was *so* into it. There is an important part of making things make sense, making them joyful. There’s delightful thing because if you don't have that, then the entire system looks like something you don't want to touch.\n\nOf course software needs to solve a problem. I think Tony Fadell captures this well with his [“make painkillers, not vitamins”](https://www.inc.com/graham-winfrey/nest-tony-fadell-on-bringing-innovation-to-market.html) quip, but we’ve lost a lot of **craft and appreciation** for making great interfaces that work well and feel amazing.\n\nIt needs to be both. We need to help solve customer problems **and** we need to make the interactions wonderful. We’ve *discredited* and *downplayed* visual design but that’s the actual thing customers touch and click! In the name of getting a seat at the table we threw away the art of making apps look and feel **great**.\n\nThere must be a better balance.\n\n---\n\nI’ve pulled a few quotes from [the episode](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2025/07/31/ep-428). Here’s around 1 hr 50 min:\n\n> John Gruber: I had a friend who, recently-ish, ex-Apple, he had been there doing design work for 15 plus 20 years? I don't know, but he left somewhat recently, and he watched [[the Aqua introduction video](https://youtu.be/dHrVGk0WwYM?t=381)]… and said, “I forgot that Steve talked like that about using UI design lingo, like *key window* and *input focus* and things like that.” He said to me that he had meetings with Alan Dye's team in recent-ish years and that he’d used terms like that. And he said, “I never got cut off, but there was always an underlying tone of *shut up with the UI nerd stuff*.” That they didn't use terms like that, and that when describing an idea, that their eyes would roll back in their head, “Here goes another one of these key-window input-focus guys again.”\n> \n> Meanwhile, they’re the fucking team that shipped an iPad multi-window interface for 7 years where you couldn't tell which half of the screen was active.\n\n> Louie Mantia: You and I have talked about this before, this exact thing like years ago, but we **solved that problem** like over a decade ago. Why are we doing this right now where we are backtracking on the things that we already know to be true? I mean, it doesn't really make any sense to me why it’s hard to distinguish the inactive window.\n\nThere’s *so much* in this episode. This snippet in particular highlights that there’s a disdain for making interfaces usable within Apple. I’m not sure it’s even their third or fifth priority. I worry it’s *not even on their list*.\n\nJohn Gruber also had the opportunity to ask Alan Dye years ago about how Apple Watch handled overlapping hour, minute, and second hands on analog watch faces:\n\n> Every physical watch with analog hands, the hands are stacked in the same order: where the hour hand is on the bottom, the minute hand is on top of the hour hand, and if there's a second hand, it's on top of the minute hand so that the hours, minutes, seconds are going forward.\n> \n> An Apple Watch renders the hands in the same Z-axis order. It’s not perfectly flat. And they render a sort of shadow around things so that you could see like when the minute hand is slightly overlapping…\n> \n> I had a question about the light source for the shadow, and I was like, *oh finally*, I get to ask Alan Dye about this.\n> \n> And he was like, “Oh, we render a shadow?”\n> \n> I just instantly realized: you’d never really even looked at it that closely. Like *somebody* at Apple has, but Alan Dye didn’t… I just remember thinking at that very moment, it just suddenly came to me, “oh, he doesn't do what I thought he did.”\n\nRelated, a bit later (around the 2 hr 31 min mark) from Louie:\n> [Steve] had a level of familiarity with [details]. I don't just know this because *my team* worked on it. I know it because I use it every day.\n\nAt first blush, it may seem unfair to criticize a VP at a multi-trillion-dollar corporation with this sort of minutia. But this is the *watch face* of the Apple Watch. (It’s not some [obscure macOS system settings screen](https://mastodon.social/@siracusa/114898428763571700) where the default system colors have now changed and now it’s impossible to distinguish which item is selected.) As someone who uses an Apple Watch **I** have personally seen this shadow. Once or twice in the 10 years of wearing this dang computer on my wrist I’ve looked down at my wrist and it’s been 1:05, 2:10 or 3:15, and so on. If you have an Apple Watch, you, (yes, even you dear reader!) probably have seen this shadow too.\n\nIt’s like Alan Dye has never used the computers his teams are responsible for designing.\n\n---\n\nThere’s a great segment about John’s [Auteur Theory of Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbrfsXYoyCI&pp=ygUUYXV0ZWFyIGRlaXNnbiBncnViZXI%3D) where he talks about how authorship differs between books (Mark Twain’s *Huckleberry Finn*), film (Steven Spielberg’s *Jaws*), and software (an app, and operating system, etc) as the number of people involved increases:\n\n> John Gruber: My conclusion was that the level of quality of the work of a company, whether it’s hardware or software or something in between, eventually rises or falls to the level of taste of the person who’s *ultimately in charge* of it and gets to say yes or no. And I think we’re seeing Apple's UI design, not the styling, which is a separate issue, but the quality of the semantic design of the user interface, sort of fall apart because like you said, I don't know that there is person. It’s like trying to make a movie without a director.\n\n> Louie Mantia: I think all of these people can collectively say, “this is their app”, or “this is their OS that they worked on,” that they are the author. I think everyone who works on this stuff is entitled to say that they made it — unequivocally. But there has to be this person and that **everyone’s meeting that vision**. And I've used the word “vision” to describe this thing like directorial stuff. There is someone's vision that they have and when it meets that, that’s when we’re shipping.\n\n---\n\nThere’s a great analogy of a costume designer for a Wes Anderson movie. That person (likely) doesn’t dress like a Wes Anderson character every day in real life. But when they to work on a Wes Anderson movie, they know what’s *expected of them* and they rise to that bar and adjust their taste. They know the assignment.\n\nFrom Louie Mantia, around 2 hr 32 min:\n> My question that I’ve had is, why does [Alan Dye] have this job? Why is he the person that does it?\n> \n> Even if you don't think Wes Anderson makes the best movies, I think we have to agree, he is the definition of that auteur — one-million percent that kind of person — so you have this clear vision and everyone is in service of that. You see it in the people that are the cinematographers, you see it in the people that are the actors that he chooses, everyone there is fully committed to the vision and I think that was true when Steve was there.\n> \n> Everyone, and I’ve talked with friends at Apple that have been there, that used to work there, people I used to work with, everyone agrees about this: Everyone was happy to let go of their own personal idea of how things should be in service of the **vision** that Steve generally had. Yes we were still making all these individual decisions. Yes we were still deciding how, but we were all in the back of our minds, “like what is the thing that we are guiding towards?” and it was always toward the vision that Steve.\n\nWhen I rejoined John Deere a couple years ago we were going through a transformation (following the [Silicon Valley Product Group](https://www.svpg.com/) model). We had someone whose title literally has “director” in it who started establishing large reviews for upcoming features with a few goals: increase awareness across the organization, break down silo walls, improve collaboration, and raise the quality bar. This person would attend these reviews and provide honest (and fair!) feedback. Quite often their critique was not that the designs “weren’t good”, but that the team hadn’t considered all the various parts of our ecosystem and failed to loop-in teams should have been looped-in.\n\nThis person’s goal was to **elevate the quality** of the entire organization. This level of scrutiny and attention to detail meant that everyone started *thinking differently*. We all started thinking, “we better do a good job on this and think end-to-end because we know we’ll get that feedback from you-know-who.” Over the years I’ve noticed this director’s presence a bit less in these reviews (except for big things) but the process and practice changes have remained. We know that this person *could* show up and we all strive to do better work because of it.\n\nThat’s what I think about when I hear about Gruber and Louie talk about **vision** and improving quality. We have to aspire and reach to make things of high quality. It doesn’t happen just by hiring talented people, you have to push a bit.\n\n---\n\nAround 2 hr 40 min:\n> *Gruber:* [Talking about Aqua] The language of that era of Apple design encompassed that range that Steve Jobs set out to cover from novice to pro.\n\n> *Louie:* The style of Aqua was so adaptable and that’s what made it work. Those productivity tools (Final Cut, Logic) didn’t ignore Aqua. They acknowledged Aqua. They understood what it was trying to do. They adapted it to their product. Aperture was entirely graphic, right? Even GarageBand was super playful, right? GarageBand had wood on the side of the thing but it took away almost no screen real estate… but it puts you in a mood. It puts a visual clarity on what *this* app is versus what this *other* app is. At no point did it look like it was not part of the same system. There was a **visual richness** to Aqua that was like: so the system looks like *this*. Even if we have buttons that are rich Corinthian leather, even if we have buttons that are wood, right? Even if we have these other materials, they need to match this level of quality, of this visual quality that [Aqua] has.\n> \n> Everyone is working on this movie, right? Everyone sees what the direction is and everyone’s like, okay, so in the “Aqua Cinematic Universe”, there's actually more room for it than just Aqua, right? And that was true on iOS too. Early iOS stuff, when it was iPhoneOS: iPhone OS had all of these different kinds of material qualities to it where any app could do whatever we wanted, especially because it was taking up the full screen at the time. You could do anything and it was *not* incongruous with the system. As long as you acknowledged what the system was trying to do, then you could play with a little bit.\n> \n> Can you do that with Liquid Glass? Because it feels to me that if it doesn’t look like Liquid Glass, then it looks wrong on the platform, right? There's no alternative quality. There’s no alternative material to use. It’s not like you can suddenly use paper, but make it looks like it belongs in the “Liquid Glass Cinematic Universe.”\n\n> *Gruber:* And that’s why I'm so disappointed overall with the big new UI [redesign]. We didn't even know what it was supposed to look like, but there were rumors for the last year that Apple’s doing a big platforms-spanning UI redesign and that it’s going to add some kind of texture and glass and something. I was so hopeful that it would bring back some of that era. Some of that tactical quality, some of that richness.\n\nThere’s a lot to unpack here and I just loved this segment.\n\nAfter some time with macOS Tahoe, I find myself getting lost at glance in a sea of sameness. As an industry we’ve been chasing down *consistency* and *design systems* for basically forever. Familiarity has amazing qualities. It means you can learn one piece of software and have that translate across the system. (For example: once you learn system features like the macOS menu bar or *Customize Toolbar*, all your apps open up to you. To borrow an old Cocoa/AppKit analogy: you’re starting on the third floor instead of the basement.)\n\nThis *sea of sameness* across macOS presents itself: every window is expanse of white with glass buttons (with terrible toolbar gradient shadows). Nothing is visually identifiable at a glance.\n\nFrom John Gruber, around 21 min:\n> But say what you want about the [stitched leather]. “Oh, I like the way that looks” or “I like the gimmick” of the way it looks. It undeniably made the Calendar window instantly recognizable. \n\nNot only is there very little character left in these apps they’re *overly* same-y and harder to differentiate when using the system as a whole.\n\n---\n\nOn platform familiarity, here’s around 2 hr 20 min:\n\n> *John:* Xcode is a pretty good example of standard good Apple Mac UI design. And I know that you [random developer] have been using it for years because you’ve been making iOS apps for years. But somehow you've been using Xcode and not paying *any* attention whatsoever to the interface?\n\n> *Louie:* I’m not saying this is the cause, but I do wonder, over the years with the iOS-ification of a bunch of things and with iOS becoming like a more dominant platform in everyone’s hands, there’s also been simultaneously a decrease in macOS. … A lot of people use Safari as an interface for web apps that they use *a lot* more. Some people’s docks look like Finder, Safari, Trash. And you're like, “what? I can't even imagine it.” But that is how some people live.\n\nI do have hope for the future. My suggestion to all designers, whether you work at Apple or anywhere else, is to take some time to understand the [underlying foundations](https://www.nngroup.com/books/tog-on-interface/) of what makes the Mac great. I worry designers who sit in front of a Mac 8 hours a day don’t understand just how great it is *beneath the surface* (how menus work, how keyboard navigation works, etc) and are content with throwing a design over the wall to their developers.\n\nAs a result you’re only thinking surface-level about your designs, putting together LEGO-pieces from your design system and that’s about it.\n\n---\n\nBefore I sign off for this post, I also want to direct your attention to a complimentary podcast episode:\n\nIn [ATP 650](https://atp.fm/650) John Siracusa talks about how UI design is a **science** and an **art**. It has to be both. How well does this design *perform* (science) and how does it make people *feel* (art). Siracusa’s argument is that the balance is completely out of whack at Apple. You have Alan Dye in charge of interface design, influencing how the entire world of *millions of designers* think about UI and it’s clear he is completely unqualified to do the job:\n\n> Alan Dye, who apparently comes from like a MarCom background, which is marketing, communication, like in print design, doesn't even have a background in user interface design…\n> \n> But I assure you, user interface design still is a field of study, at least in the academic world, where people try to make interfaces more usable to people by using **reason** and **testing things** and not just having a whim and deciding I want stitched leather because I think it’s cool and reminds me of seat backs on my private jet (or whatever the heck the story behind that was…)\n> \n> That's an important part of it, but there has to be a balance. I feel like the balance is way, way, way, way, way too far in the direction of the art and emotion side, which again is an important factor, but it's can't be the only factor.\n> \n> And if you're on way on the art side and you make an interface that people don't find appealing, now you've got a real problem because it's not usable. It's not useful. You're making the interface worse and people don't even think it's cool looking.\n\nUnderstand what makes and interface great — both art and science — and push for your teams to take both seriously.\n\n---\n\nPS: I got these quotes thanks to a combination of macOS Tahoe’s transcription model via [Yap](https://github.com/finnvoor/yap) by [Finn Voorhees](https://finnvoorhees.com/), [MacWhisper Pro](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper), and the [unofficial transcript](https://podsearch.david-smith.org/episodes/7773) from David Smith’s [podsearch](https://podsearch.david-smith.org/).\n",

It’s not as high-fidelity as it was on my Mac mini set up but there’s <em>zero</em> of those friction points. I can even <em>switch</em> (ha!) to handheld mode and take it on the go. That’s the joy of console gaming, especially with Nintendo where it’s plug-and-play and system updates take 30 seconds instead of 30 minutes.</p>\n<p>My last anecdote with the Switch 2 is our first night with it: we were trapped in a hotel room with a kid who goes to bed at 7 PM. We sat on the opposite end from where the kid was asleep and we put the Switch 2 in table top mode. My wife and I each had a Joy-Con and we had a blast playing a few rounds of Grand Prix in <em>Mario Kart World</em> before heading to bed. (It wouldn’t be until the next week that I discovered the sheer delight of Knockout mode.)</p>\n<p>This post is really just here to say, and it’s gonna sound dumb: I like when gaming is <strong>fun</strong>. You hit a button and the Switch wakes up and you’re right back to getting blown to bits by a Guardian or sprinting away from a Lynel. Nintendo just makes it so nice to play games and I’m excited for the Switch 2 era to kick off.</p>\n",

It’s not as high-fidelity as it was on my Mac mini set up but there’s *zero* of those friction points. I can even *switch* (ha!) to handheld mode and take it on the go. That’s the joy of console gaming, especially with Nintendo where it’s plug-and-play and system updates take 30 seconds instead of 30 minutes.\n\nMy last anecdote with the Switch 2 is our first night with it: we were trapped in a hotel room with a kid who goes to bed at 7 PM. We sat on the opposite end from where the kid was asleep and we put the Switch 2 in table top mode. My wife and I each had a Joy-Con and we had a blast playing a few rounds of Grand Prix in *Mario Kart World* before heading to bed. (It wouldn’t be until the next week that I discovered the sheer delight of Knockout mode.)\n\nThis post is really just here to say, and it’s gonna sound dumb: I like when gaming is **fun**. You hit a button and the Switch wakes up and you’re right back to getting blown to bits by a Guardian or sprinting away from a Lynel. Nintendo just makes it so nice to play games and I’m excited for the Switch 2 era to kick off.\n",

Loved it! Took a break afterwards but will watch season 3 soon.\n- [_English Teacher_](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/258902-english-teacher) with Brian Jordan Alvarez is an FX show on Hulu. We found it hilarious.\n- Season 2 of _The Big Door Prize_ on Apple.\n- Season 2 of _The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power_ on Amazon. Spoilers(?) but it was so obvious that “the stranger” was Gandalf. _Who else would it have been?_\n- [_Sunny_](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/157226-sunny) on Apple with Rashida Jones was interesting but not sure it “stuck the landing.”\n- Really enjoyed [_Penelope_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penelope_(TV_series)) on Netflix. This caught my attention after hearing [Mark Duplass’ interview on _The Town_](https://www.theringer.com/podcasts/the-town-with-matthew-belloni/2024/09/25/how-to-make-your-own-tv-show-and-get-netflix-to-buy-it) where I learned it was self-funded _and_ he retains the rights — not Netflix.\n",

To my knowledge it’s the first time he’s been credited as a “featuring…” on a Coldplay track (as opposed to being relegated to liner notes) but he’s worked with Coldplay as far back as 2008’s opening track on <em>Viva La Vida</em>. The opener here too is absolutely brilliant and I was completely lost in it.</p>\n<p><em>Feelslikeimfallinginlove</em> has a strange combination of having energy — especially in the chorus — while being a slow, low-key rhythmic vibe. It was a solid choice for a lead single.</p>\n<p><em>We Pray</em> is a more successful version of <em>Princess of China</em> with Rihanna, or <em>Hymn for the Weekend</em> with Beyoncé. I don’t know the artists featured but I enjoy how <em>different</em> this song feels and it has definitely grown on me.</p>\n<p><em>Jupiter</em> is an absolute joy that fills your heart with an upbeat message. Ya gotta love the acoustic guitar and cello.</p>\n<p><em>Good Feelings</em> with Arya Starr is a funky good time with a stellar guitar riff halfway in. It sounds like it could have been on Daft Punk’s <em>Random Access Memories</em> or on a Passion Pit record.</p>\n<p><em>Rainbow</em> is filled with dreamy synths, ripping guitar, a beautiful piano interlude, and spoken audio from Maya Angelou reminds me of M83’s <em>Hurry Up We’re Dreaming</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Iaam</em> (“I Am a Mountain”) is like a throwback to <em>Glass of Water</em> from 2009 but without the heart. The mix itself is hollow: tonally, lyrically, and energy. It stays at one level the whole time.</p>\n<p><em>Aeterna</em> is a groovy tune my brother. I’m looking forward to hearing <em>many</em> remixes that take this jam to full-on EDM music. Nice vocal outro too. (I think they played this live at Glastonbury and it looked like a rockin’ time.)</p>\n<p><em>All My Love</em> is a classic, piano-centric Coldplay love song with a great string ensemble. It feels like this song has been in the air forever yet is somehow new. (Reminds me of their demo of <em>Wedding Bells</em> many moons ago.) I wanna sit down at the piano and learn it.</p>\n<p><em>One World</em> has vamping synths, piano, guitar which fall away to a hundred humming voices then trails to <em>another</em> breathtaking string piece. Some Pink Floyd vibes at the very beginning then goes straight to M83 for its crescendo.</p>\n<p>(The outro had me wondering if they forgot to come back and record the words — but there’s also something charming in its rawness.)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There’s a lot of variety in <em>Moon Music</em> and a lot to like. Musically there are some <strong>incredible</strong> moments, especially in the more complex instrumental compositions. Lyrically it left me wanting with two too many songs rely on “la la la” as a chorus.</p>\n<p>As a continuous listening experience, it moves nicely throughout but there’s an unevenness. (The incongruity from <em>We Pray</em> to <em>Jupiter</em> is a bit of whiplash.)</p>\n<p>To be sure, there is some beautiful music here (if you like Coldplay) but time will tell if this is a good <em>album</em> that stands out in the annals of time like <em>Viva la Vida</em>. Maybe by my tenth listen I can check back in.</p>\n<p>My first listen was laying in bed with headphones and I’m looking forward to hearing it on my speakers tomorrow for a totally different listening experience.</p>\n",

I don’t know the artists featured but I enjoy how _different_ this song feels and it has definitely grown on me.\n\n_Jupiter_ is an absolute joy that fills your heart with an upbeat message. Ya gotta love the acoustic guitar and cello.\n\n_Good Feelings_ with Arya Starr is a funky good time with a stellar guitar riff halfway in. It sounds like it could have been on Daft Punk’s _Random Access Memories_ or on a Passion Pit record.\n\n_Rainbow_ is filled with dreamy synths, ripping guitar, a beautiful piano interlude, and spoken audio from Maya Angelou reminds me of M83’s _Hurry Up We’re Dreaming_.\n\n_Iaam_ (“I Am a Mountain”) is like a throwback to _Glass of Water_ from 2009 but without the heart. The mix itself is hollow: tonally, lyrically, and energy. It stays at one level the whole time.\n\n_Aeterna_ is a groovy tune my brother. I’m looking forward to hearing _many_ remixes that take this jam to full-on EDM music. Nice vocal outro too. (I think they played this live at Glastonbury and it looked like a rockin’ time.)\n\n_All My Love_ is a classic, piano-centric Coldplay love song with a great string ensemble. It feels like this song has been in the air forever yet is somehow new. (Reminds me of their demo of _Wedding Bells_ many moons ago.) I wanna sit down at the piano and learn it.\n\n_One World_ has vamping synths, piano, guitar which fall away to a hundred humming voices then trails to _another_ breathtaking string piece. Some Pink Floyd vibes at the very beginning then goes straight to M83 for its crescendo.\n\n(The outro had me wondering if they forgot to come back and record the words — but there’s also something charming in its rawness.)\n\n---\n\nThere’s a lot of variety in _Moon Music_ and a lot to like. Musically there are some **incredible** moments, especially in the more complex instrumental compositions. Lyrically it left me wanting with two too many songs rely on “la la la” as a chorus.\n\nAs a continuous listening experience, it moves nicely throughout but there’s an unevenness. (The incongruity from _We Pray_ to _Jupiter_ is a bit of whiplash.)\n\nTo be sure, there is some beautiful music here (if you like Coldplay) but time will tell if this is a good _album_ that stands out in the annals of time like _Viva la Vida_. Maybe by my tenth listen I can check back in.\n\nMy first listen was laying in bed with headphones and I’m looking forward to hearing it on my speakers tomorrow for a totally different listening experience.\n",

Well I took the time to [figure that out](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftdata/how-to-use-swiftdata-in-swiftui-previews) (thanks to Paul Hudson) and now I can iterate way faster. There’s a **ton** of optimizations like this that add up.\n\nI’m not sure this new design is a slam dunk: I'm trying to get a feel for it by using it daily. Even if I revert to the old design the code will be in a _much_ better place.\n\nTinkering with a new design is a fun distraction :-) but I probably should be thinking about iOS 18 features like [Dark Mode app icons](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons#Platform-considerations) and App Intents[^1] ahead of [Apple Intelligence](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppIntents/Integrating-your-app-with-siri-and-apple-intelligence).\n\nAs a newbie app developer I hit a **lot** of brick walls. It can be truly frustrating. But when I figure it out, it feels like flying.\n\n\n[^1]: We use [Mango Baby](https://mangobaby.app/) which has _extensive_ App Intent support. Between widgets, live activities, and Siri integration. This app has it all and inspires me to deeply integrate MapKeep with iOS.\n",

				"title": "The Trials and Tribulations of Creating Delta Skins on iPadOS",
				"content_html": "<p>I decided to work on <a href=\"https://github.com/AndrewHaglund/delta-absorb\">Absorb</a>, my <a href=\"https://noah978.gitbook.io/delta-docs/skins\">custom Gameboy skin</a> for the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688\">Delta emulator</a>, from my shiny new 11-inch iPad Pro. There’s been a lot of conversation around what the iPad can and cannot do so I thought I’d give this a try. This is <em>fairly</em> complex work involving designing in Figma, editing JSON files, managing files, and committing code to GitHub. Let’s see how the experiment went.</p>\n<h2 id=\"figma\">Figma</h2>\n<p>Designing in Figma on iPadOS is a bit of a cluster. Their marketing claims it works great in “any browser” but apparently that generous definition does not extend to Safari for iPad. If you use it directly in the browser you get weird behavior. For example, pinching with your fingers will zoom the canvas where pinching on a trackpad will zoom the entire web page. There is <a href=\"https://figurative.design/\">Figurative</a> but this has its own tradeoffs: if I left and came back it would force reload the file because it was “out of memory” and irritatingly ⌘c and ⌘v don’t work. Generally it felt like wearing mittens — the iPadOS cursor is great but it still feels like a small meaty pointer and not the precise pointer you find on macOS.</p>\n<p>Critically dealing with custom fonts is a mess on iPadOS. <a href=\"https://blog.iconfactory.com/2020/06/introducing-fontcase/\">Fontcase</a> by the Iconfactory folks is great but it lives within Apple’s barbaric iPadOS font system. I used <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/fonts/\">SF Pro Rounded</a> for my button labels and I completely bailed on trying to get this onto iPad. Apple provides these fonts in a macOS Installer within a <code>.dmg</code> file, which is to decidedly <em>not</em> iPadOS-friendly. How does Figma handle missing fonts? Well by making text uneditable. Fun.</p>\n<p>Exporting PDFs out of Figma into the Files app worked great and I was able to get a lot of design work done from my iPad. It was slow-going and the font issue ultimately drove me back to the Mac.</p>\n<p>I have an itch to try making a Figma plugin to make it super easy to create Delta skins. That’s for another day though.</p>\n<h2 id=\"editing-json\">Editing JSON</h2>\n<p>Delta’s skin system is pretty straightforward. You provide PDFs of the UI your users will see and then give the coordinates of all the buttons in a JSON file. This mapping can get unwieldy though as each device and orientation is all within a single JSON file.

				"content_text": "\nI decided to work on [Absorb](https://github.com/AndrewHaglund/delta-absorb), my [custom Gameboy skin](https://noah978.gitbook.io/delta-docs/skins) for the [Delta emulator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688), from my shiny new 11-inch iPad Pro. There’s been a lot of conversation around what the iPad can and cannot do so I thought I’d give this a try. This is *fairly* complex work involving designing in Figma, editing JSON files, managing files, and committing code to GitHub. Let’s see how the experiment went.\n\n## Figma\nDesigning in Figma on iPadOS is a bit of a cluster. Their marketing claims it works great in “any browser” but apparently that generous definition does not extend to Safari for iPad. If you use it directly in the browser you get weird behavior. For example, pinching with your fingers will zoom the canvas where pinching on a trackpad will zoom the entire web page. There is [Figurative](https://figurative.design/) but this has its own tradeoffs: if I left and came back it would force reload the file because it was “out of memory” and irritatingly ⌘c and ⌘v don’t work. Generally it felt like wearing mittens — the iPadOS cursor is great but it still feels like a small meaty pointer and not the precise pointer you find on macOS.\n\nCritically dealing with custom fonts is a mess on iPadOS. [Fontcase](https://blog.iconfactory.com/2020/06/introducing-fontcase/) by the Iconfactory folks is great but it lives within Apple’s barbaric iPadOS font system. I used [SF Pro Rounded](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) for my button labels and I completely bailed on trying to get this onto iPad. Apple provides these fonts in a macOS Installer within a `.dmg` file, which is to decidedly *not* iPadOS-friendly. How does Figma handle missing fonts? Well by making text uneditable. Fun.\n\nExporting PDFs out of Figma into the Files app worked great and I was able to get a lot of design work done from my iPad. It was slow-going and the font issue ultimately drove me back to the Mac.\n\nI have an itch to try making a Figma plugin to make it super easy to create Delta skins. That’s for another day though.\n\n## Editing JSON\nDelta’s skin system is pretty straightforward. You provide PDFs of the UI your users will see and then give the coordinates of all the buttons in a JSON file. This mapping can get unwieldy though as each device and orientation is all within a single JSON file. (It would be kind of nice if each PDF had its own JSON to make these files way more manageable.)\n\nOn the Mac and other desktop platforms there’s VS Code for code editing and committing code to GitHub. It’s fantastic. It has a great [sticky scrolling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM4Vhrk4irY) feature which means you don’t lose your context. Even still it can be a pain doing all this text entry and all too often I’d forget a `,` or a `:` and everything would break!\n\nVS Code is nowhere to be found on iPadOS and I could not find a text editor for iPad that had this sticky scrolling feature… but I ran into Simon Støvring’s [Jayson](https://jayson.app) (ha) app for editing JSON files with a GUI. This is far more approachable as you no longer need to think of the syntax for JSON and making a mistake. But it also involved a lot of navigating in-and-out due to the hierarchy of Delta’s skin system (where you have to drill into `dictionary 0` to see it’s the “A” button then back out to adjust its coordinates). Using this was better than typing manually, for sure, but I think there’s a lot of opportunity for Simon to optimize this app for fewer clicks and faster navigating up-and-down the hierarchy.\n\nThis app is also available on macOS but it’s a bare-minimum Catalyst version of the iPad app. (Sorry if I sound negative! I’m glad it exists on macOS but this was a rare case where the superior experience was definitely on iPad.)\n\nThis part of the process is a huge fun suck but that’s not the iPad’s fault.\n\n## Managing Files\nTechnically a Delta skin is just a renamed ZIP file of a JSON file and some PDFs. I downloaded a [template](https://noah978.gitbook.io/delta-docs/skins) to get started, exported my designs as PDFs from Figma to the Files app, edited the JSON file in Jayson, and was able to select the files, compress, and change the extension from `.zip` to `.deltaSkin`. Pretty easy. I didn’t have any issues with the Files app other than some slow exports from Figurative.\n\n## Committing Code to GitHub\nI chose to host my files as an [open source project on GitHub](https://github.com/AndrewHaglund/delta-absorb). The big asterisk here is that my Figma files are not *yet* public. While I’ll host these themes on Gumroad and [DeltaStyles](https://deltastyles.com) for discoverability I thought it was in the spirt of Delta emulator itself being [open source](https://github.com/rileytestut/Delta) that my files are “out there” for anyone.\n\nDoing all the file management of creating the skins (zipping, renaming, editing JSON, exporting PDFs) meant that I wanted a good git client. Turns out there is [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com) by [Anders Borum](https://indieapps.space/@palmin@mastodon.social)! I happily paid $25. It stings a *little* knowing VS Code is free on macOS and it handles everything I need, but this Working Copy is a powerhouse. (I’ll be able to use this app for posting to my blog so it’s not just a one-time cost.)\n\nAfter committing changes on my iPad I was able to iteratively test and debug my new GBA skin on my iPhone by sending it over AirDrop, make changes on iPad, send over, commit my work, and so on until I got everything working just right.\n\n## Conclusion\nWhile I had to fallback to the Mac for the design part — partly due to wanting a bigger screen and iPadOS font limitations — I was able to do most of this work from my iPad.\n\nThis is an exciting prospect as I tend to keep my MacBook Pro docked at my desk as a “desktop laptop.” This makes my iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard a perfect “around the house” machine.

				"content_text": "\n> The best Gameboy is the one you have with you.\n\nI have been having a blast playing _Pokémon Crystal_ (specifically the [Polished Crystal](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=373172) romhack) for the Gameboy Color, _Tetris_, and _Mario & Luigi: Bowser’s Inside Story_ for the Nintendo DS with [Delta for iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688). At the time of this post Delta **is still #1** in the App Store thanks to Apple’s sudden and inexplicable[^1] change of heart. It’s an incredible app that’s been in the works for a [long time](https://github.com/rileytestut/Delta) by Riley Testut. You can support it on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/rileyshane).\n\nI’ve been having fun making a [custom skin](https://noah978.gitbook.io/delta-docs/skins) for Gameboy Color to improve the screen size and ergonomics in landscape.[^2] I’ve been playing with the [Gamesir G8 controller](https://www.gamesir.hk/products/gamesir-g8-galileo) — which is great.[^3] Pokémon is fine with onscreen controls but a real controller is ideal for games like _Super Mario World_ and _Tetris_.\n\nWhat makes retro gaming on iPhone so special is everything that makes the iPhone such a compelling product: great support for wireless headphones, great battery life, streaming to your TV with AirPlay, and game controller support. This entire ecosystem was just _dying_ to get emulation added to the mix. Federico and John covered this well on [MacStories Unwind](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/macstories-unwind/id1510451759?i=1000653687197).[^4]\n\nThe past few years I’ve been following along with Russ at [Retro Game Corp](https://retrogamecorps.com/author/onionsaregross/) and have bought the [Miyoo Mini](https://retrogamecorps.com/2022/05/15/miyoo-mini-v2-guide/), a [couple](https://anbernic.com/products/rg353v-rg353vs) [Anbernics](https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xx-h), and even the [Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket). I see now that I have a problem but I find comfort in knowing [Brendon Bigley](https://wavelengths.online/posts/on-cheap-handhelds-in-a-world-of-smartphone-emulation) (of [_Into the Aether_](https://intothecast.online/)) is in the same boat.\n\nWhile these devices can be great uni-taskers with good physical controls, they all fall short of the iPhone when it comes to screen quality, staying charged, and **convenience**:\n\nWhile waiting in line for coffee on Sunday I pulled out my iPhone and played a few Pokemon battles (thanks to turbo mode) and caught a Jigglypuff. There’s _no way_ I would have even thought to bring one of those other devices on this quick neighborhood outing. Combine that with auto-saving when putting the phone to sleep — it’s just so easy to dip in and out.\n\n---\n\nAs photography nerds like to say: _the best camera is the one you have with you_. This has been proven with the smartphone and now we’re seeing it all over again with [Delta](https://faq.deltaemulator.com).\n\n_The best Gameboy is the one you have with you._\n\n[^1]: To anyone who says regulation and competition don’t work, exhibit A is Delta and Apple [changing the rules](https://www.theverge.com/24139004/apple-app-store-retro-game-emulators-ios-console-ports-storystream) after _16_ godforsaken years.\n\n[^2]: It’s not ready to share but I will _definitely_ will.

Angelica (Lencia Kebede) and King George III (Paul Louis Lessard) were fantastic. It’s tough comparing to the original cast but those two were standouts.</li>\n<li><em>The Witch</em> (Krannert Center for the Performing Arts) was a modern and fun retelling of <em>The Witch</em> from the 1600s.</li>\n</ul>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>We renovated our home offices, removing the 1970s faux wood paneling and dropped acoustic panel ceiling.

If 80% of your runtime is about laundry, you know you’ve screwed up. A few nice moments but overall a huge miss. (Also a main character’s name is Noodle. Noodle!)\n\n**February**\n- _Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3_ was fine. Good ending to the series I guess. _Thor Ragnorok_ and _Guardians 1_ were lightning-in-a-bottle and their sequels have all been a letdown.\n- _Jenny Slate: Seasoned Professional_ was incredibly funny. This was the first time we had watched her standup. I only knew her from _Parks & Rec_.\n- _Paterson_ (2016): very random but I was in a hotel room so I had nothing else going on. Dan Benjamin mentioned it in [_Back to Work 638_](https://www.backtowork.limo/638) so I gave it a shot. Slow and sleepy but a nice slice of life.\n- _Oppenheimer_ (rewatch). I watched this with my parents (it was their first viewing) and as soon as credits rolled both of them went “woah” and that’s when I knew it’d win Best Picture.\n- _American Fiction_ was excellent. Jeffrey Wright and the whole cast were outstanding.\n- _Princess Mononoke_: I’m slowly watching all the Ghibli/Miyazaki movies. This one’s surprisingly violent! Beautiful animation.\n- _Asteroid City_: I am a longtime fan of Wes Anderson but this movie just made me angry. Everything about this production is world-class: cast, costume, and designs; but the story had no heart. I felt _nothing_.\n\n**January**\n- _Anatomy of a Fall_ was a great mystery. It played with the timeline of events really well. The courtroom scenes, while probably not realistic, were exceptional.\n- _May December_ had terrific performances by Portman and Moore. The ending felt a bit anticlimactic. The ending made us think, “wait, that’s it?”\n- _Maestro_ is world-class. Bradley did good. The scene where he’s conducting in the cathedral was incredible. Classical music FTW.\n- _Killers of the Flower Moon_ was outstanding. I read the book a few years ago and thought Marty did a great job adapting it into a riveting story. Like _Oppenheimer_ you’d have no idea this was 3 hours long, it flew by.\n\n## Books\n- _Shift_ (book 2 of _Silo_ series)\n\n## Theater\n- We saw _Hamilton_ in Chicago. I listened to the soundtrack a bunch in 2020 and saw the Disney Plus version. My parents and brother went in cold turkey and we all had a blast. Angelica (Lencia Kebede) and King George III (Paul Louis Lessard) were fantastic. It’s tough comparing to the original cast but those two were standouts.\n- _The Witch_ (Krannert Center for the Performing Arts) was a modern and fun retelling of _The Witch_ from the 1600s.\n\n[^1]: We renovated our home offices, removing the 1970s faux wood paneling and dropped acoustic panel ceiling. This allowed us to vault the ceilings, raising it about 5 feet. I still need to do sound dampening and decorating but it’s a nice improvement.\n\n[^2]: We said goodbye to our 2015 Subaru Forester (with only 60,000 miles!). We bought a lightly used 2021 RAV4 Prime plug-in hybrid. It feels like the future: so many fancy safety features. The 40 mile all-EV mode is wonderful for daily errands. Then the gas engine is there for long-distance trips. Best of both worlds. Charging infrastructure is sparse in Illinois and we’re a 1-car family so we could not justify going all-in on a full EV, _yet_.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>The other weekend my wife and I watched the excellent <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em> on Apple TV+. We opted to skip the theatrical and digital purchase windows despite loving <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/193388249-killers-of-the-flower-moon\">the book</a> and Apple’s caginess around when <em>exactly</em> the film would debut on the streaming service.</p>\n<p>Right off the bat the movie’s <a href=\"https://soundtracks.lnk.to/killersofflower\">soundtrack</a> by the <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/listen-to-robbie-robertson-soundtrack-for-new-martin-scorsese-movie-killers-of-the-flower-moon/\">late Robbie Robertson</a> set the tone<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> and pace. We were hooked. A few minutes in, however, we started noticing blocky pixels — the video stream oscillating between vivid 4K and 240p pixelated mush from minute to minute.</p>\n<p>It was just how Marty intended.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>I naively thought pausing would give it a chance to buffer and it’d be smooth sailing. As the stuttering continued I restarted the Apple TV, force quit the TV app, ran a speed test<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup> and yet the issue persisted. Then the stream <em>completely</em> failed and a panic set upon the room. Life happens pretty fast. You never know the next time you’ll have the time and disposition to watch a three hour movie. <strong>It was now or never.</strong></p>\n<p>I wondered if the problem was with <em>streaming</em> the movie so I opened the TV app on my iPhone, found the movie, and hit download. A minute later the download completed and I used AirPlay to put it on the TV. The rest of the movie went without a hitch<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup> and we enjoyed the riveting and heartbreaking story of the Osage killings.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It was less than ideal needing two Apple devices to watch an Apple-produced movie. This is because Apple TV+ in the TV app on the Apple TV hardware does not support <strong>downloading</strong> video. For inexplicable reasons this overpriced hockey puck comes in <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-tv/apple-tv-4k\">2 storage tiers</a> but you can’t actually <em>store</em> anything on it.</p>\n<p>That said I can see why Apple might not want to implement this feature:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlike an iPhone you’re unlikely to take an Apple TV with you on an airplane and need to load up on movies before takeoff.</li>\n<li>Then there’s the messiness of managing and removing downloaded media.</li>\n<li>I fear Apple is allergic of buttons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whether you have a slower than average network at home, intermittent server outages, or taking an Apple TV to a hotel or Airbnb TV with crappy Wi-Fi, there are scenarios that could make this feature worthwhile.</p>\n<p>The most straightforward solution is offering a download button on the episode or movie detail view — just like on iOS and the Mac. (Maybe a long press on the Play button could expose a menu with this option.)</p>\n<p>Another idea is treating download as a <em>fallback</em> to streaming. Maybe the OS could notice streaming quality is low and prompt the user with something like, “Download movie? This can take a few moments but should play without interruption afterwards.” Playback could resume from the same spot using the local file and get automatically offloaded 24 hours later.</p>\n<p>I know offline downloading is not a glamorous feature but little touches like this could make the Apple TV a bit more forgiving in the real world.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>Parts of it remind me of the <em>Breaking Bad</em> theme music, but extended to cover a 3 hour movie.

We opted to skip the theatrical and digital purchase windows despite loving [the book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/193388249-killers-of-the-flower-moon) and Apple’s caginess around when *exactly* the film would debut on the streaming service.\n\nRight off the bat the movie’s [soundtrack](https://soundtracks.lnk.to/killersofflower) by the [late Robbie Robertson](https://pitchfork.com/news/listen-to-robbie-robertson-soundtrack-for-new-martin-scorsese-movie-killers-of-the-flower-moon/) set the tone[^1] and pace. We were hooked. A few minutes in, however, we started noticing blocky pixels — the video stream oscillating between vivid 4K and 240p pixelated mush from minute to minute.\n\nIt was just how Marty intended.[^2]\n\nI naively thought pausing would give it a chance to buffer and it’d be smooth sailing. As the stuttering continued I restarted the Apple TV, force quit the TV app, ran a speed test[^3] and yet the issue persisted. Then the stream *completely* failed and a panic set upon the room. Life happens pretty fast. You never know the next time you’ll have the time and disposition to watch a three hour movie. **It was now or never.**\n\nI wondered if the problem was with *streaming* the movie so I opened the TV app on my iPhone, found the movie, and hit download. A minute later the download completed and I used AirPlay to put it on the TV. The rest of the movie went without a hitch[^4] and we enjoyed the riveting and heartbreaking story of the Osage killings.\n\n---\n\nIt was less than ideal needing two Apple devices to watch an Apple-produced movie. This is because Apple TV+ in the TV app on the Apple TV hardware does not support **downloading** video. For inexplicable reasons this overpriced hockey puck comes in [2 storage tiers](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-tv/apple-tv-4k) but you can’t actually *store* anything on it.\n\nThat said I can see why Apple might not want to implement this feature:\n\n- Unlike an iPhone you’re unlikely to take an Apple TV with you on an airplane and need to load up on movies before takeoff.\n- Then there’s the messiness of managing and removing downloaded media.\n- I fear Apple is allergic of buttons.\n\nWhether you have a slower than average network at home, intermittent server outages, or taking an Apple TV to a hotel or Airbnb TV with crappy Wi-Fi, there are scenarios that could make this feature worthwhile.\n\nThe most straightforward solution is offering a download button on the episode or movie detail view — just like on iOS and the Mac. (Maybe a long press on the Play button could expose a menu with this option.)\n\nAnother idea is treating download as a *fallback* to streaming. Maybe the OS could notice streaming quality is low and prompt the user with something like, “Download movie? This can take a few moments but should play without interruption afterwards.” Playback could resume from the same spot using the local file and get automatically offloaded 24 hours later.\n\nI know offline downloading is not a glamorous feature but little touches like this could make the Apple TV a bit more forgiving in the real world.\n\n[^1]: Parts of it remind me of the *Breaking Bad* theme music, but extended to cover a 3 hour movie. It’s an excellent listen on its own.\n\n[^2]: Aside from the obvious financial benefits and prestige that come with a theatrical release, I’m sure directors like Scorsese get bummed out by the idea of someone watching their movie on a cramped phone screen or buffering through the first 15 minutes.\n\n[^3]: Totally normal behavior when encountering the slightest delay of internet television.\n\n[^4]: Except when the cable from my iPhone knocked my beer into the living room rug. Less than ideal.\n",

When I think about the implications for how this data could be misused (off the dome: planting false evidence at a crime scene, the inevitability of nonconsensual cloning), I have a hard time racking my brain for data that’s more sensitive.

In September I launched my first app, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833\">MapKeep</a>.</p>\n<p>I noodled around with an app for Merlin Mann’s <a href=\"https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom/blob/master/wisdom.md\">Wisdom Project</a> and a packing/shopping list app based on Myke Hurley’s request in <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/489\">Upgrade 489</a>). These projects are on-hold for now.</p>\n<p>Weebly hosted my personal site for 10 years but I grew tired of its outdated editor and <em>godawful</em> blogging tools. I used this as an excuse to learn HTML/CSS and rebuilt my site from scratch. At the end of December the site was rebuilt again using <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev\">Eleventy</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"travel\">Travel</h2>\n<p>I visited Des Moines, IA, for a week every quarter for “in-person week” at work. My brother happened to live there which meant we could get dinner downtown or watch an episode of <em>The Sopranos</em> at his apartment. Those days are behind us now that he’s moved to Chicago. It reminds me to always take advantage of opportunities to see family.</p>\n<p>I went to Florida to visit sugar cane growers in February. The area was recovering from <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/us/hurricane-ian-fort-myers-beach-florida/index.html\">Hurricane Ian</a> and the destruction was awful. Fort Myers Beach was on a boil order. The hotel was underwater days before I checked-in. I spent a few hours walking the beach and marveled at collapsed hotels, restaurants, and homes.</p>\n<p>In May we went to Michigan for a high-school friend’s wedding. A week later we went to a cousin’s high school graduation in Denver and we hiked at <a href=\"https://www.jeffco.us/1332/Mount-Falcon-Park\">Mount Falcon Park</a>.</p>\n<p>As an annual tradition we spent a week with my in-laws in Madison, WI, in June visiting downtown, breweries, and the <a href=\"https://union.wisc.edu/visit/terrace-at-the-memorial-union/\">UW Union Terrace</a>. In August we made a trip to Missouri for our niece’s 2nd birthday.</p>\n<p>At the end of September a close friend and college roommate got married in the Virginia/DC area.

				"content_text": "\n## Preamble\nMy goal is to collect the stories and art I experienced in 2023 with a sprinkle of personal updates. Reflecting on the year was a fun process and I hope to turn this into an annual tradition.\n\n## Tech Stories\nThere were a lot of disastrous tech stories this year but [23andMe’s data breach](https://www.wired.com/story/23andme-credential-stuffing-data-stolen/) has a special spot in my heart. When I think about the implications for how this data could be misused (off the dome: planting false evidence at a crime scene, the inevitability of nonconsensual cloning), I have a hard time racking my brain for data that’s more sensitive. Stories like this *should* remind us to be more thoughtful of what we put online. Based on what I see on LinkedIn (a “professional” network), society has ways to go.\n\nOther stories that spring to mind are [GM’s bone-headed decision to drop CarPlay](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/gm-justifies-decision-to-ditch-apple-carplay-due-to-stability-issues/) and the spectacular bungled effort to [fire Sam Altman](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23981848/sam-altman-back-open-ai-ceo-microsoft-board). The world came *this close* to Microsoft hiring every employee from OpenAI.[^1]\n\nSpeaking of close calls: [Adobe almost acquired Figma](https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-adobe-abandon-proposed-merger/). I’m bummed for the Figma employees (who missed out on a big windfall) but this is probably for the best.\n\nWe saw the [collapse of Twitter](https://www.axios.com/2023/12/31/elon-musks-x-fidelity-valuation-cut), which was bound to happen, but did anyone think it’d deteriorate this quickly? In its wake we saw the [meteoric launch of Threads](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/10/23787453/meta-instagram-threads-100-million-users-milestone) and [Mastodon’s](https://joinmastodon.org/) slow-and-steady growth. I hope smaller services like [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) are getting their day in the sun. In 2024 and beyond I’m ready for a [weirder internet](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-commentary/internet-future-about-to-get-weird-1234938403/).\n\nIt’s for these reasons I’m starting a blog.[^2] After years of posting to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrewhaglund) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/andrewhaglund/), it’s time to have a proper home on the web. I’ve settled on:\n- Short, frequent posts on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@haglund)\n- Long, infrequent posts here ([subscribe via RSS](/feed.xml))\n\n## The Year of Development\nI prefer [Yearly Themes](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/150) over resolutions and while I didn’t plan a theme for 2023, reflecting on the past year helped a theme emerge retroactively: *the Year of Development*.\n\nAfter the initial excitement of the [Vision Pro unveiling at WWDC](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/wwdc23-highlights/) I spent many summer nights and weekends learning SwiftUI and SwiftData. In September I launched my first app, [MapKeep](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833).\n\nI noodled around with an app for Merlin Mann’s [Wisdom Project](https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom/blob/master/wisdom.md) and a packing/shopping list app based on Myke Hurley’s request in [Upgrade 489](https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/489)). These projects are on-hold for now.\n\nWeebly hosted my personal site for 10 years but I grew tired of its outdated editor and *godawful* blogging tools. I used this as an excuse to learn HTML/CSS and rebuilt my site from scratch. At the end of December the site was rebuilt again using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev).\n\n## Travel\nI visited Des Moines, IA, for a week every quarter for “in-person week” at work. My brother happened to live there which meant we could get dinner downtown or watch an episode of *The Sopranos* at his apartment. Those days are behind us now that he’s moved to Chicago. It reminds me to always take advantage of opportunities to see family.\n\nI went to Florida to visit sugar cane growers in February. The area was recovering from [Hurricane Ian](https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/us/hurricane-ian-fort-myers-beach-florida/index.html) and the destruction was awful. Fort Myers Beach was on a boil order. The hotel was underwater days before I checked-in. I spent a few hours walking the beach and marveled at collapsed hotels, restaurants, and homes.\n\nIn May we went to Michigan for a high-school friend’s wedding. A week later we went to a cousin’s high school graduation in Denver and we hiked at [Mount Falcon Park](https://www.jeffco.us/1332/Mount-Falcon-Park).\n\nAs an annual tradition we spent a week with my in-laws in Madison, WI, in June visiting downtown, breweries, and the [UW Union Terrace](https://union.wisc.edu/visit/terrace-at-the-memorial-union/). In August we made a trip to Missouri for our niece’s 2nd birthday.\n\nAt the end of September a close friend and college roommate got married in the Virginia/DC area. We had great time reminiscing over our stupidity in college.\n\n## Work\nI continue to work for John Deere as a UX Lead and love it. I was recently promoted and my area of responsibly has grown and I now directly manage a few designers. I’m adjusting to the new role and I’ll be reading *[The First 90 Days](https://hbr.org/books/watkins)* ASAP.\n\nI’m fortunate to have a [great mentor and manager](https://inkypixelsdesign.com). This was a tough year for layoffs across a lot of industries and I don’t take my position for granted.\n\nI try to stay connected with the University of Illinois and in March I gave a talk about the design process at the [Siebel Center of Design](https://designcenter.illinois.edu/).\n\n---\n\n## Games\nI’m approaching the end of the main storyline in *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom* and … what a masterpiece. *Mario Wonder* was a blast! 2023 was [filled with amazing games](https://intothecast.transistor.fm/episodes/the-2023-game-of-the-year-spectacular) and I expect my [OLED Steam Deck](https://www.steamdeck.com/oled) can help expose me to more non-Nintendo games in 2024.\n\nI’ve been playing retro games:\n- *Pokémon Red* ([Anniversary romhack](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/2362/)) and *Tetris* on my silver [Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket).\n- The [PC port](https://www.shipofharkinian.com) of *Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time* on the Mac.\n- *Super Mario World*, naturally.\n\nThis Christmas the [Genki dock](https://www.genkithings.com/products/covert-dock-2) let my cousins and I (ranging from ages 12 to 32) play local co-op with 6-players in *Super Smash Bros*. Chaotic joy.\n\n## Podcasts\nI heard the podcast ad market was tough in 2023. Hosts would mention this occasionally and I noticed fewer (or zero) ads. I decided to open [my wallet](https://bellroy.com/products/card-sleeve-wallet?color=hazelnut&material=leather&size=default) and financially support the work I love:\n\n- *[Accidental Tech Podcast](https://atp.fm/)*: Exceptionally consistent. Gotta support John now that [he’s gone indie](https://hypercritical.co/2022/03/30/independence-day).\n- *[Into the Aether](https://intothecast.online)*: I have a tremendous appreciation for the art of video game creation thanks to Brendon and Stephen.\n- *[Roderick on the Line](http://www.merlinmann.com/Roderick/)*: I’ve been listening to the internet’s Merlin Mann and the Long Winters’ John Roderick for a *long time*.\n- *[Upgrade](https://www.relay.fm/upgrade)*: Myke and Jason’s segments on Apple and the entertainment industry keep me coming back week after week.\n\nI loved [Sir McCartney’s show](https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/mccartney-a-life-in-lyrics) where he tells the stories behind his killer songs.[^3]\n\nIn 2024 I want to reduce my podcast intake or introduce more variety. It’s too easy for me to pop-in an AirPod and tune-out the world. I’m not giving myself enough time for silence.\n\n## Music\nThanks to Apple Music’s awkward [Replay](https://replay.music.apple.com/) feature I have a list of most-listened music from 2023:\n\n- *[the record](https://boygenius.lnk.to/therecord)* by boygenius\n- *[GUTS](https://oliviarodrigo.lnk.to/GUTS)* by Olivia Rodrigo\n- *[Fantasy](https://m83.lnk.to/fantasy)* by M83\n- *[WE](https://af.lnk.to/_WEAW)* by Arcade Fire (2022)\n- *[Multitudes](https://interscope.lnk.to/Multitudes)* by Feist\n- *[Asphalt Meadows (Acoustic)](https://death-cab-for-cutie.lnk.to/AMAcoustic)* by Death Cab for Cutie\n- *[The Land Is Hospitable and So Are We](https://mitski.lnk.to/TLIIASAW)* by Mitski\n- *[Oppenheimer](https://music.apple.com/us/album/oppenheimer-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1697599270)* by Ludwig Göransson\n- *[Random Access Memories](https://daftpunk.lnk.to/RAM_Originals)* by Daft Punk (2013) is routinely played on Friday afternoons as work winds down. (I will **not** link to the drumless abomination.)\n\nOther music highlights:\n- I started digging into Peter Gabriel’s *[i/o](https://lnk.to/PG21)*. There are 3 mixes of the album which is fascinating. I can’t explain it but the acoustic guitar in the opening track *Panopticom* fills me with joy.\n- Sufjan Stevens’ *[Javelin](https://sufjanstevens.lnk.to/javelin)* was lovely but I haven’t listened to it enough.\n- I recorded a short composition called [*A Quiet Night*](https://soundcloud.com/andrewhaglund/a-quiet-night).\n- As part of a Christmas gift I introduced my brother to some chords on the guitar.\n- My hopes are high for Michael Stipe’s [first post-R.E.M. album](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/03/magazine/michael-stipe-solo-album.html) (I first heard it teased on [Smartless](https://www.smartless.com/episodes/episode/24585bee/michael-stipe)). The [*Up* remaster](https://found.ee/rem-up25) was impeccable.\n\nLive shows:\n- [Rodrigo y Gabriela](https://www.rodgab.com) at Krannert’s [Ellnora](https://krannertcenter.com/ellnora) festival. They’re gods. (Thanks to Señora Kooy, my high school Spanish teacher, who originally introduced me to this duo.)\n- [Lauren Mayberry](https://laurenmayberry.co.uk) of Churches at the Rose Bowl. I missed seeing her opener, [Claud](https://toastmp3.bandcamp.com/album/supermodels) whose record is a gift to humanity.\n- YouTube concerts don’t count but my brother was at a very similar show to [Bon Iver at Pitchfork](https://youtu.be/TolZh65YsmM?si=mGJnauI28TmKEXYv).\n\nOne last note: we all heard a new Beatles song this year. Its authenticity is contentious but seeing [people singing *Now and Then* in Central Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzcsKb8iLY&pp=ygUZbm93IGFuZCB0aGVuIGNlbnRyYWwgcGFyaw%3D%3D) is something. It’s hard to imagine this song hasn’t been around for 50 years.\n\n## Reading\nI started supporting [kottke.org](https://kottke.org) by becoming a [member](https://kottke.org/members). His site is an invaluable source of information on the internet across a variety of topics and help satiates my curiosity.\n\nI read *[Expecting Better](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/310896/expecting-better-by-emily-oster/)* which is the *Freakonomics* of pregnancy.\n\n30 seconds into Apple’s trailer for [*Silo*](https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2023/06/apple-tv-renews-hit-world-building-drama-silo-for-season-two/) and I was hooked. Before the show aired I read the first book, *[Wool](https://hughhowey.com/books/wool/)*. I’m currently reading *[Shift](https://hughhowey.com/books/shift/)*, book 2 of 3. If you’re a fan of the show, read the books.\n\n(I *think* I read more than this but I don’t have a good tracking system.)\n\n\n## Movies\nThroughout the year I used [Sofa](https://www.sofahq.com) to track what I watched.
