			 <p>I’m working on a <a href="https://haglund.app/mapkeep">MapKeep</a> update for iOS 26 and Liquid Glass. It’s been a roller coaster: I’m having fun adding new features but searchable breaks key interactions and SwiftUI broke my my long-press gesture code (for the 2nd year in a row).</p>
<p>Making apps is… fun?</p>

			 <p>The new design of iOS and macOS 26 this summer has been controversial to say the least. To my eyes the glass effects do, in fact, look cool. But many aspects of the design make no logical sense. Apple’s obsession with “getting the UI out of the way of your content” is absurd and when you look at how they <em>executed</em> on this idea, it’s clear they didn’t achieve that goal: The new UI is more distracting, less predictable, less stable, and less readable than ever before.</p>
<p>I’ve been using Apple’s new design language on my iPad and Mac, following the discourse and reception to it, and it has me thinking about the design industry as a whole. Apple’s reputation looms large in the design world. Many designers look up to Apple. We look to them for guidance to define what it means to make “a good app.” My concern at the moment: if Apple has lost its way, will the world of design blindly follow, or will they think critically and assess if Apple’s vision and direction is any good?</p>
<p>There is certainly a level of craft and quality achieved within Liquid Glass, some (but <a href="https://mastodon.social/@marcoarment/114927268189889547">not all</a>) of the transitions and effects are kind of mesmerizing. Underlying this layer of unusable glass is seemingly <em>nothing</em>. There used to be a solid foundation of human-computer interaction principles that <em>sat beneath</em> the visual quality of the design from Apple. In fact, they were trailblazers and founding-members of this discipline. The Apple designers of the past understood the importance of contrast, differentiating controls, and studying how users thought and felt about their interfaces by studying their behavior. It’s clear that this approach to design is no longer in power at Apple.</p>
<hr>
<p>I consider <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2025/07/31/ep-428">Episode 428 of <em>The Talk Show</em></a> to be required listening if you design or build software. There are too many quotes to pull from but trust me, just listen to all (3 hours) of it. <a href="https://lmnt.me/">Louie Mantia</a> is the guest and I have the utmost admiration and respect for his taste and <a href="https://parakeet.co/">work</a>. His recent blog post, <a href="https://lmnt.me/blog/a-responsibility-to-the-industry.html">A Responsibility to the Industry</a>, covers many of the same points I’m making here. It was this post (and others) that sparked John Gruber to invite Louie onto the show.</p>
<p>The conversation revolves around the new operating systems featuring Liquid Glass. One thing that struck me is how design has shifted over time to say <em>UX</em> (or user experience) as opposed to <em>UI</em> (or user interface). This episode talks about the “how it works” of software design but it also covers a ton about how it “looks and feels”. You could argue Apple’s new design language over-prioritizes “looks and feel” and leaves behind the “how it works.”</p>
<p>In 2025 I feel too much of the design industry has lost the attention to detail and focus on the “look and feel” of software. Over the past 10-15 years UX practitioners have had to beg and claw to get a seat at the table at companies. We’ve had to prove and argue what a good experience is worth. This absolutely helped grow our industry and bring design thinking into many more organizations.</p>
<p>As part of this transition to power, however, we’ve too often cozied-up to the “suits” to ensure we’re delivering <em>value</em> and we’ve pitched ourselves as “we’re not <em>just</em> UI designers, we think about the entire user experience”. While this sounds good, the issue is that it implies that making nice interfaces is <strong>not valuable</strong> in-and-of itself. This is false! Think of <em>slide to unlock</em> from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKMoT-6XSg">original iPhone</a> debut. Here&rsquo;s Louie around 2 hr 14 min:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first interaction we had with iPhone was slide to unlock. [Jobs] did it twice because everyone was <em>so</em> into it. There is an important part of making things make sense, making them joyful. There’s delightful thing because if you don&rsquo;t have that, then the entire system looks like something you don&rsquo;t want to touch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course software needs to solve a problem. I think Tony Fadell captures this well with his <a href="https://www.inc.com/graham-winfrey/nest-tony-fadell-on-bringing-innovation-to-market.html">“make painkillers, not vitamins”</a> quip, but we’ve lost a lot of <strong>craft and appreciation</strong> for making great interfaces that work well and feel amazing.</p>
<p>It needs to be both. We need to help solve customer problems <strong>and</strong> we need to make the interactions wonderful. We’ve <em>discredited</em> and <em>downplayed</em> visual design but that’s the actual thing customers touch and click! In the name of getting a seat at the table we threw away the art of making apps look and feel <strong>great</strong>.</p>
<p>There must be a better balance.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ve pulled a few quotes from <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2025/07/31/ep-428">the episode</a>. Here’s around 1 hr 50 min:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John Gruber: I had a friend who, recently-ish, ex-Apple, he had been there doing design work for 15 plus 20 years? I don&rsquo;t know, but he left somewhat recently, and he watched [<a href="https://youtu.be/dHrVGk0WwYM?t=381">the Aqua introduction video</a>]… and said, “I forgot that Steve talked like that about using UI design lingo, like <em>key window</em> and <em>input focus</em> and things like that.” He said to me that he had meetings with Alan Dye&rsquo;s team in recent-ish years and that he’d used terms like that. And he said, “I never got cut off, but there was always an underlying tone of <em>shut up with the UI nerd stuff</em>.” That they didn&rsquo;t use terms like that, and that when describing an idea, that their eyes would roll back in their head, “Here goes another one of these key-window input-focus guys again.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they’re the fucking team that shipped an iPad multi-window interface for 7 years where you couldn&rsquo;t tell which half of the screen was active.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Louie Mantia: You and I have talked about this before, this exact thing like years ago, but we <strong>solved that problem</strong> like over a decade ago. Why are we doing this right now where we are backtracking on the things that we already know to be true? I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t really make any sense to me why it’s hard to distinguish the inactive window.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s <em>so much</em> in this episode. This snippet in particular highlights that there’s a disdain for making interfaces usable within Apple. I’m not sure it’s even their third or fifth priority. I worry it’s <em>not even on their list</em>.</p>
<p>John Gruber also had the opportunity to ask Alan Dye years ago about how Apple Watch handled overlapping hour, minute, and second hands on analog watch faces:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every physical watch with analog hands, the hands are stacked in the same order: where the hour hand is on the bottom, the minute hand is on top of the hour hand, and if there&rsquo;s a second hand, it&rsquo;s on top of the minute hand so that the hours, minutes, seconds are going forward.</p>
<p>An Apple Watch renders the hands in the same Z-axis order. It’s not perfectly flat. And they render a sort of shadow around things so that you could see like when the minute hand is slightly overlapping…</p>
<p>I had a question about the light source for the shadow, and I was like, <em>oh finally</em>, I get to ask Alan Dye about this.</p>
<p>And he was like, “Oh, we render a shadow?”</p>
<p>I just instantly realized: you’d never really even looked at it that closely. Like <em>somebody</em> at Apple has, but Alan Dye didn’t… I just remember thinking at that very moment, it just suddenly came to me, “oh, he doesn&rsquo;t do what I thought he did.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Related, a bit later (around the 2 hr 31 min mark) from Louie:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Steve] had a level of familiarity with [details]. I don&rsquo;t just know this because <em>my team</em> worked on it. I know it because I use it every day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first blush, it may seem unfair to criticize a VP at a multi-trillion-dollar corporation with this sort of minutia. But this is the <em>watch face</em> of the Apple Watch. (It’s not some <a href="https://mastodon.social/@siracusa/114898428763571700">obscure macOS system settings screen</a> where the default system colors have now changed and now it’s impossible to distinguish which item is selected.) As someone who uses an Apple Watch <strong>I</strong> have personally seen this shadow. Once or twice in the 10 years of wearing this dang computer on my wrist I’ve looked down at my wrist and it’s been 1:05, 2:10 or 3:15, and so on. If you have an Apple Watch, you, (yes, even you dear reader!) probably have seen this shadow too.</p>
<p>It’s like Alan Dye has never used the computers his teams are responsible for designing.</p>
<hr>
<p>There’s a great segment about John’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbrfsXYoyCI&amp;pp=ygUUYXV0ZWFyIGRlaXNnbiBncnViZXI%3D">Auteur Theory of Design</a> where he talks about how authorship differs between books (Mark Twain’s <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>), film (Steven Spielberg’s <em>Jaws</em>), and software (an app, and operating system, etc) as the number of people involved increases:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John Gruber: My conclusion was that the level of quality of the work of a company, whether it’s hardware or software or something in between, eventually rises or falls to the level of taste of the person who’s <em>ultimately in charge</em> of it and gets to say yes or no. And I think we’re seeing Apple&rsquo;s UI design, not the styling, which is a separate issue, but the quality of the semantic design of the user interface, sort of fall apart because like you said, I don&rsquo;t know that there is person. It’s like trying to make a movie without a director.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Louie Mantia: I think all of these people can collectively say, “this is their app”, or “this is their OS that they worked on,” that they are the author. I think everyone who works on this stuff is entitled to say that they made it — unequivocally. But there has to be this person and that <strong>everyone’s meeting that vision</strong>. And I&rsquo;ve used the word “vision” to describe this thing like directorial stuff. There is someone&rsquo;s vision that they have and when it meets that, that’s when we’re shipping.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>There’s a great analogy of a costume designer for a Wes Anderson movie. That person (likely) doesn’t dress like a Wes Anderson character every day in real life. But when they to work on a Wes Anderson movie, they know what’s <em>expected of them</em> and they rise to that bar and adjust their taste. They know the assignment.</p>
<p>From Louie Mantia, around 2 hr 32 min:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My question that I’ve had is, why does [Alan Dye] have this job? Why is he the person that does it?</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t think Wes Anderson makes the best movies, I think we have to agree, he is the definition of that auteur — one-million percent that kind of person — so you have this clear vision and everyone is in service of that. You see it in the people that are the cinematographers, you see it in the people that are the actors that he chooses, everyone there is fully committed to the vision and I think that was true when Steve was there.</p>
<p>Everyone, and I’ve talked with friends at Apple that have been there, that used to work there, people I used to work with, everyone agrees about this: Everyone was happy to let go of their own personal idea of how things should be in service of the <strong>vision</strong> that Steve generally had. Yes we were still making all these individual decisions. Yes we were still deciding how, but we were all in the back of our minds, “like what is the thing that we are guiding towards?” and it was always toward the vision that Steve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I rejoined John Deere a couple years ago we were going through a transformation (following the <a href="https://www.svpg.com/">Silicon Valley Product Group</a> model). We had someone whose title literally has “director” in it who started establishing large reviews for upcoming features with a few goals: increase awareness across the organization, break down silo walls, improve collaboration, and raise the quality bar. This person would attend these reviews and provide honest (and fair!) feedback. Quite often their critique was not that the designs “weren’t good”, but that the team hadn’t considered all the various parts of our ecosystem and failed to loop-in teams should have been looped-in.</p>
<p>This person’s goal was to <strong>elevate the quality</strong> of the entire organization. This level of scrutiny and attention to detail meant that everyone started <em>thinking differently</em>. We all started thinking, “we better do a good job on this and think end-to-end because we know we’ll get that feedback from you-know-who.” Over the years I’ve noticed this director’s presence a bit less in these reviews (except for big things) but the process and practice changes have remained. We know that this person <em>could</em> show up and we all strive to do better work because of it.</p>
<p>That’s what I think about when I hear about Gruber and Louie talk about <strong>vision</strong> and improving quality. We have to aspire and reach to make things of high quality. It doesn’t happen just by hiring talented people, you have to push a bit.</p>
<hr>
<p>Around 2 hr 40 min:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Gruber:</em> [Talking about Aqua] The language of that era of Apple design encompassed that range that Steve Jobs set out to cover from novice to pro.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Louie:</em> The style of Aqua was so adaptable and that’s what made it work. Those productivity tools (Final Cut, Logic) didn’t ignore Aqua. They acknowledged Aqua. They understood what it was trying to do. They adapted it to their product. Aperture was entirely graphic, right? Even GarageBand was super playful, right? GarageBand had wood on the side of the thing but it took away almost no screen real estate… but it puts you in a mood. It puts a visual clarity on what <em>this</em> app is versus what this <em>other</em> app is. At no point did it look like it was not part of the same system. There was a <strong>visual richness</strong> to Aqua that was like: so the system looks like <em>this</em>. Even if we have buttons that are rich Corinthian leather, even if we have buttons that are wood, right? Even if we have these other materials, they need to match this level of quality, of this visual quality that [Aqua] has.</p>
<p>Everyone is working on this movie, right? Everyone sees what the direction is and everyone’s like, okay, so in the “Aqua Cinematic Universe”, there&rsquo;s actually more room for it than just Aqua, right? And that was true on iOS too. Early iOS stuff, when it was iPhoneOS: iPhone OS had all of these different kinds of material qualities to it where any app could do whatever we wanted, especially because it was taking up the full screen at the time. You could do anything and it was <em>not</em> incongruous with the system. As long as you acknowledged what the system was trying to do, then you could play with a little bit.</p>
<p>Can you do that with Liquid Glass? Because it feels to me that if it doesn’t look like Liquid Glass, then it looks wrong on the platform, right? There&rsquo;s no alternative quality. There’s no alternative material to use. It’s not like you can suddenly use paper, but make it looks like it belongs in the “Liquid Glass Cinematic Universe.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Gruber:</em> And that’s why I&rsquo;m so disappointed overall with the big new UI [redesign]. We didn&rsquo;t even know what it was supposed to look like, but there were rumors for the last year that Apple’s doing a big platforms-spanning UI redesign and that it’s going to add some kind of texture and glass and something. I was so hopeful that it would bring back some of that era. Some of that tactical quality, some of that richness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a lot to unpack here and I just loved this segment.</p>
<p>After some time with macOS Tahoe, I find myself getting lost at glance in a sea of sameness. As an industry we’ve been chasing down <em>consistency</em> and <em>design systems</em> for basically forever. Familiarity has amazing qualities. It means you can learn one piece of software and have that translate across the system. (For example: once you learn system features like the macOS menu bar or <em>Customize Toolbar</em>, all your apps open up to you. To borrow an old Cocoa/AppKit analogy: you’re starting on the third floor instead of the basement.)</p>
<p>This <em>sea of sameness</em> across macOS presents itself: every window is expanse of white with glass buttons (with terrible toolbar gradient shadows). Nothing is visually identifiable at a glance.</p>
<p>From John Gruber, around 21 min:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But say what you want about the [stitched leather]. “Oh, I like the way that looks” or “I like the gimmick” of the way it looks. It undeniably made the Calendar window instantly recognizable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only is there very little character left in these apps they’re <em>overly</em> same-y and harder to differentiate when using the system as a whole.</p>
<hr>
<p>On platform familiarity, here’s around 2 hr 20 min:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>John:</em> Xcode is a pretty good example of standard good Apple Mac UI design. And I know that you [random developer] have been using it for years because you’ve been making iOS apps for years. But somehow you&rsquo;ve been using Xcode and not paying <em>any</em> attention whatsoever to the interface?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Louie:</em> I’m not saying this is the cause, but I do wonder, over the years with the iOS-ification of a bunch of things and with iOS becoming like a more dominant platform in everyone’s hands, there’s also been simultaneously a decrease in macOS. … A lot of people use Safari as an interface for web apps that they use <em>a lot</em> more. Some people’s docks look like Finder, Safari, Trash. And you&rsquo;re like, “what? I can&rsquo;t even imagine it.” But that is how some people live.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do have hope for the future. My suggestion to all designers, whether you work at Apple or anywhere else, is to take some time to understand the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/books/tog-on-interface/">underlying foundations</a> of what makes the Mac great. I worry designers who sit in front of a Mac 8 hours a day don’t understand just how great it is <em>beneath the surface</em> (how menus work, how keyboard navigation works, etc) and are content with throwing a design over the wall to their developers.</p>
<p>As a result you’re only thinking surface-level about your designs, putting together LEGO-pieces from your design system and that’s about it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Before I sign off for this post, I also want to direct your attention to a complimentary podcast episode:</p>
<p>In <a href="https://atp.fm/650">ATP 650</a> John Siracusa talks about how UI design is a <strong>science</strong> and an <strong>art</strong>. It has to be both. How well does this design <em>perform</em> (science) and how does it make people <em>feel</em> (art). Siracusa’s argument is that the balance is completely out of whack at Apple. You have Alan Dye in charge of interface design, influencing how the entire world of <em>millions of designers</em> think about UI and it’s clear he is completely unqualified to do the job:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alan Dye, who apparently comes from like a MarCom background, which is marketing, communication, like in print design, doesn&rsquo;t even have a background in user interface design…</p>
<p>But I assure you, user interface design still is a field of study, at least in the academic world, where people try to make interfaces more usable to people by using <strong>reason</strong> and <strong>testing things</strong> and not just having a whim and deciding I want stitched leather because I think it’s cool and reminds me of seat backs on my private jet (or whatever the heck the story behind that was…)</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an important part of it, but there has to be a balance. I feel like the balance is way, way, way, way, way too far in the direction of the art and emotion side, which again is an important factor, but it&rsquo;s can&rsquo;t be the only factor.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re on way on the art side and you make an interface that people don&rsquo;t find appealing, now you&rsquo;ve got a real problem because it&rsquo;s not usable. It&rsquo;s not useful. You&rsquo;re making the interface worse and people don&rsquo;t even think it&rsquo;s cool looking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understand what makes and interface great — both art and science — and push for your teams to take both seriously.</p>

<p>Sixty years ago, a determined group of local visionaries decided to turn an “educational desert” into a flourishing community college serving thousands each year.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.svcc.edu/">Sauk Valley Community College</a> marks its 60th anniversary in 2025, its founders, leaders and supporters are reflecting on how a grassroots movement built a thriving institution from the ground up while continuing to shape futures across northwest Illinois.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The college’s roots go back to 1965 when discussions began among educators, civic leaders and residents about the need for a local junior college. One of the key figures behind that movement was Pete Dillon of <a href="https://www.sterling-il.gov/">Sterling</a>, who would go on to serve as a founding member of SVCC’s first Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>“I was the first one to go to college in my family,” Dillon said. “When I came back [from school], I thought, wow, we’re kind of in an educational desert.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You can’t find someone who’s written a book on how to create a college. We were building something from nothing. But the people were genuinely committed to getting this thing done and we did it.”</p>
<p>–  Pete Dillon, a founding member of SVCC’s first Board of Trustees</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Former SVCC board member Mary Ellen Wilkinson recalled the early work Pete did even before there was a board.</p>
<p>“He worked on recruiting representatives from the various communities, and then those people had to be elected,” Wilkinson said. ”So there was a process before there was ever a board.”</p>
<p>Wilkinson said a feasibility study alone took a year and involved 100 people from 10 school districts.</p>
<p>When it came time to make the college a reality, Pete literally sketched out the foundation.</p>
<p>“I designed it at 4 in the morning in my basement,” Pete said of the Ironsides building – the college’s very first facility – built while the main campus was still under development. “The idea was that we needed something that could be used while the campus was being constructed.”</p>
<p>To generate community support, Dillon organized open houses so residents could walk through the Ironsides structure while it was still being built.</p>
<p>“We had a few thousand people come through,” Pete said. ”You probably couldn’t get away with that today.”</p>
<p>That public engagement helped lead to overwhelming support in a 1966 referendum to officially create the district.</p>
<p>“At <a href="https://www.sterlingpublicschools.org/o/shs">Sterling High School</a>, when we voted that day, we had to turn away 400 people because they couldn’t get in to vote,” Dillon recalled.</p>
<p>Even the college’s name was a community effort.</p>
<p>“There was a contest to name the college,” current SVCC President Dave Hellmich said.</p>
<p>A third-grade student at <a href="https://www.shawlocal.com/tags/dixon/">Dixon’s</a> St. Mary’s School, Michael Flanagan, submitted the winning name.</p>
<p>SVCC opened its doors in the fall of 1966 with 660 students. Today, it serves over 2,000 students each semester with a wide range of academic, career and community-centered programs, including associate degrees in art, science, or applied science in more than 35 areas and over 50 certificates.</p>
<p>During the 2024–2025 academic year, SVCC awarded 247 associate degrees, 446 career-technical certificates, and 129 credentials, totaling 822 awards.</p>
<p>Vice President of Academics and Student Services Jon Mandrell highlighted one of SVCC’s more recent accomplishments – launching a regional police academy.</p>
<p>“Public safety is a huge need. Our September class is already full,” Mandrell said. “There was a gaping hole for police training from central Illinois up to the northwest. We just kept asking and asking, and advocating for years until we were finally heard.”</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The college’s commitment to meeting local needs does not stop there. SVCC’s Vice President of Advancement Lori Cortez said the college’s Small Business Development Center supports more than 200 entrepreneurs and small businesses each year.</p>
<p>“Whether it’s to start up a business, keep their business going, or help them retire and transfer it to someone else, we’re here,” Cortez said.</p>
<p>SVCC is also helping local high school students invest in their futures.</p>
<p>The college’s <a href="https://www.svcc.edu/impact/index.html">Impact Program</a> helps local high school students pay for their tuition when they complete volunteer service hours. Last year, <a href="https://www.shawlocal.com/sauk-valley/2025/01/22/from-hvac-to-new-track-sterling-schools-finalizing-2025-facility-plan-project-list/">it was awarded</a> the Lieutenant Governor’s Award for Excellence in Revitalization.</p>
<p>The college has also evolved beyond its original mission by offering select four-year degree options in partnership with universities.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t part of the original concept,” Wilkinson said, “But once you get your foot in the door and you see what’s possible, it makes a huge difference.”</p>
<p>Cortez agreed.</p>
<p>“Our data backs that up,” Cortez said. “Our retention rate here at the college is about 20% higher than other community colleges.”</p>
<p>Today, SVCC’s campus stretches across 150 scenic acres along the Rock River between Sterling and Dixon, a location that Pete helped negotiate during 30 days of daily visits and coffee with a reluctant landowner to seal the deal.</p>
<p>Looking back, Pete said none of the founding team had a playbook.</p>
<p>“You can’t find someone who’s written a book on how to create a college,” Pete said. “We were building something from nothing. But the people were genuinely committed to getting this thing done and we did it.”</p>
<p>Now 60 years on, Sauk Valley Community College is not only still standing, it is thriving, and still grounded in the values that built it: accessibility, persistence and a deep belief in what’s possible when a community comes together.</p>
<p>“You won’t find a better value in this world than a community college,” Mandrell said.</p>

<p>P.S. the “F” stands for Fun and the 1 stands for the “first” movie in a trilogy. Next summer: <em>F2</em>?</p>

			 <p>I’m a big fan of <em>Severance</em> and I’m so glad Ben and Adam are back for a few episodes of <a href="https://www.audacy.com/podcast/the-severance-podcast-with-ben-stiller-adam-scott-947fe">their podcast</a> this summer to follow up the impeccable season 2. The first episode, <a href="https://overcast.fm/+ABMvfQ9_3ms/"><em>Points of Vibration</em></a> is a major overlapping Venn diagram for me since it guest stars Conan O’Brien (go Team Coco).</p>
<p>Around <a href="https://overcast.fm/+ABMvfQ9_3ms/26:46">26 minutes</a> Conan talks about why he loves the show, which captures what I resonates with me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[My son] loves it. And we talk about it. And then my wife will get into the conversation and we’ll really drill down in it and discuss things. And that is my favorite thing; shows that invite discussion, debate afterwards. When someone else makes a world that I believe is real, I’m taken for this great ride and I am invited to be part of it. And it’s just, you know, joyous. It’s great. You guys built a world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also like the format in <em>Severance</em>: something very serious is happening. And Mark has, we know that he’s widowed, believes he’s widowed. He’s gone through a terrible tragedy. He wants to escape. It’s very dark. There’s some truly dark moments, but then Tramell [Tillman], as Milchick, will go into that dance. And I laughed. I mean, I stood on my feet when that happened.</p>
<p>Because when you set up a world like <em>Severance</em>, when the comedy does come in, or not even comedy, something comes in at an odd angle and there’s so many very funny moments, but it can come 30 seconds after someone really believes that the love of their life has gone forever. And so I’m at the mercy of the show, which I really like. I’m just there to witness this world.</p>
<p>I also have to say, I love the way the computers look, the way there’s this kind of mid-80s, late-80s design aesthetic. And so the cars are very generic and square and all of the stuff. I find myself <em>looking at the stuff</em> and the way it’s lit and the way the shots are composed.</p>
<p>And, you know, we live in this world now where people say, “was it a TV show or is it a movie?” I think we’re beyond that now because yes, this is <em>technically</em> a television show, but as someone who has hosted the Oscars, I don’t really see the difference anymore. You string all of <em>Severance</em> together with different edits and you make some cuts here and there and you make something that’s three and a half hours long. And I don’t see why that’s not an Oscar-worthy film.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>They also interviewed Allen Stare, host of the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/severed-the-ultimate-severance-podcast/id1660658805"><em>Severed</em></a> podcast (which I had not heard of). He conducts <em>tons</em> of research into the production of the show and goes far beyond a typical rewatch podcast.</p>
<hr>
<p>Not related to the show but I loved Conan’s anecdote <a href="https://overcast.fm/+ABMvfQ9_3ms/13:41">around the 13 minute mark</a> about his personality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My father was a scientist and he once looked at me — and he wasn’t kidding — and he went, “I think I understand. You’re making your living off something that should be treated.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I certainly relate to this. I find that the things I get obsessive about are some of the same reasons I’m can be gainfully employed as a halfway-decent designer. (It bleeds into all areas of my life.)</p>

			 <p>A few weeks ago while heading to Wisconsin I strolled into a Target on Nintendo Switch 2 launch day, an hour after opening, and snagged a Switch 2 with <em>Mario Kart World</em>. It seemed liked there was a steady stream of buyers. As soon as someone checked out another would arrive but there wasn’t really a line, per se.</p>
<p>I gave up on getting a Switch 2 (at least immediately) after failing to secure one during preorders. But I was keen on replaying Zelda <em>Breath of the Wild</em> in 4K after seeing so many YouTube videos showing how good it looked.</p>
<p>This began a quest involving Mac gaming, OLED monitors, and finding the zen of console gaming.</p>
<hr>
<p>I got <em>Breath of the Wild</em> working using CEMU on my Mac mini running at 5K resolution 60 frames per second and it looked <strong>fantastic</strong>. My Mac was humming along without even kicking on the fan and the quality was unreal. Apple’s display is not ideal for gaming so I started looking into some fancy OLED 4K monitors. After tinkering a bit I got the game running at 4K 240 frames per second and it was <strong>glorious</strong>. It was like I was seeing Hyrule for the first time, just absolutely stunning. I settled in and decided I’m gonna replay <em>Breath of the Wild</em> over the next 6 months on my Mac.</p>
<p>But this came with downsides like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stutters from shader caching</li>
<li>Annoyances with button mapping and connecting my controller</li>
<li>Small thing: but the clicks to open CEMU, pick Zelda, get to fullscreen.</li>
<li>Figuring out how to transfer my save file if I wanted to put it on our MacBook Air to play away from my desk (I tried the built in macOS Screen Sharing but no dice. It doesn’t support controller input and neither does Moonlight for macOS.)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are definitely the first-est of first-world problems, no doubt. But they’re friction and time-consuming and when you have limited gaming time (because you have a 1-year-old kid) it adds up.</p>
<hr>
<p>So now I have my surprise Switch 2 and I happily paid $10 to upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition. After some difficulty downloading (hotel Wi-Fi is crap. Bring an ethernet cable, kids. Shoutout to the concierge who dug through the back office to find me one) I was ripping through Hyrule and it was <strong>stunning</strong>. It’s not as high-fidelity as it was on my Mac mini set up but there’s <em>zero</em> of those friction points. I can even <em>switch</em> (ha!) to handheld mode and take it on the go. That’s the joy of console gaming, especially with Nintendo where it’s plug-and-play and system updates take 30 seconds instead of 30 minutes.</p>
<p>My last anecdote with the Switch 2 is our first night with it: we were trapped in a hotel room with a kid who goes to bed at 7 PM. We sat on the opposite end from where the kid was asleep and we put the Switch 2 in table top mode. My wife and I each had a Joy-Con and we had a blast playing a few rounds of Grand Prix in <em>Mario Kart World</em> before heading to bed. (It wouldn’t be until the next week that I discovered the sheer delight of Knockout mode.)</p>
<p>This post is really just here to say, and it’s gonna sound dumb: I like when gaming is <strong>fun</strong>. You hit a button and the Switch wakes up and you’re right back to getting blown to bits by a Guardian or sprinting away from a Lynel. Nintendo just makes it so nice to play games and I’m excited for the Switch 2 era to kick off.</p>

			 <p>As mentioned in my <a href="https://haglund.micro.blog/2024/03/31/q-update.html">Q1 2024 update</a> I was not a fan of <em>Asteroid City</em>. I was lukewarm on <em>The French Dispatch</em> as well so I was starting to think Wes Anderson’s work just wasn’t for me anymore (which is totally fine!). I’m a huge fan  <em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em>, <em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em>, and <em>The Darjeeling Limited</em>.</p>
<p>Every project has the potential of greatness. His latest movie <em>The Phoenician Scheme</em> I think achieves this. It combines his fascination with miniatures and over-the-top sets (and 90º angles) with genuine and funny dialog from his earlier work. Where his recent work felt soulless, there was heart here. This is as close to an “action movie” that Wes will likely go and I was enthralled. Michael Cera also shines with the most bizarrely charming accent.</p>
<p>Two thumbs up!</p>

			 <p>Yesterday it hit mid-50s. In central Illinois this is cause for much celebration. I went on a few walks, got some food, and observed the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A cluster of students leaving a neighbor’s house, all speaking French.</li>
<li>Two women holding hands, one with an eye patch.</li>
<li>At lunch at the new H Mart, practically <em>everyone</em> was speaking Korean or Japanese.</li>
<li>A group of students fundraising on the Quad for the war in Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
<p>By all counts, a town in the middle of cornfields should be as plain as a slice of Wonder bread. Instead it’s abuzz with people from all over the world. People who came here as students or teachers to better themselves and others.</p>

<p>Molly Rankin, in the episode:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was one of my first attempts at really trying to execute writing something that I would listen to. Until then I was writing a lot of stuff I wouldn’t go out of my way to hear. I wanted it to be a classic pop song.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lyrics remind me so much of my wife and our wedding. We had plans for a larger wedding but then COVID hit and we turned it into an outdoor family party. With the exception of my friends and faraway family not being able to attend, it turned out to be way more our speed.</p>
<p>“Forget the flower arrangements,” indeed.</p>
<hr>
<p>An absolute crazy thing is that the only time I’ve seen Alvvays play was in the foyer at the Krannert Music Center in Urbana, IL at Pygmalion fest in 2016. After we paid to see Car Seat Headrest, Alvvays were just playing in the atrium for free where local jazz bands play on weeknights. It was <em>unreal</em>. Here was the band I loved just <em>there</em>. It was a really fun time.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been on a Bowie kick recently (because check notes: Bowie is amazing). Some recent listens: <em>Blackstar ★</em> (2016), <em>The Next Day</em> (2013), <em>Scary Monsters</em> (1980), <em>“Heroes”</em> (1977), and <em>Ziggy Stardust</em> (1972). It’s unbelievable that his last album (and death) was 9 years ago. From <em>Lazarus</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look up here, I’m in heaven. I’ve got scars that can’t be seen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This song absolutely <em>rips</em>. Knowing he was dying when he wrote it <em>rips through you</em>. I remember hearing the album in the day it dropped and again two days later when the world learned he had passed away. It took on an entirely new meaning.</p>
<hr>
<p>There’s been scuttle online about an asteroid hitting earth in 2032. <a href="https://interconnected.org/home/2025/02/14/asteroid">Matt Webb’s post</a> captures what I found entertaining about the overall sentiment. It reminds me of the great song <em>Five Years</em> whose drumbeat lives in my head rent-free.</p>
<p>Also, who could forget <a href="https://youtu.be/g8f_XCH3zmM">the greatest tribute to Bowie</a>: “This is Bowie to Bowie, do you hear me loud and clear, man?”</p>
<p>When it seems like the world is in disarray, clutch onto art.</p>

			 <p>I flew today but didn’t learn of last night’s crash until <em>after</em> I landed. I cannot imagine what the families were going through and my hearts go out them.</p>
<hr>
<p>I could not help but emphatically nod along when I saw <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1ie0rpr/comment/ma3wa07/">this comment on Reddit</a> describing the timeline of events:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jan 20: FAA director fired</li>
<li>Jan 21: Air Traffic Controller hiring frozen</li>
<li>Jan 22: Aviation Safety Advisory Committee disbanded</li>
<li>Jan 28: Buyout/retirement demand sent to existing employees</li>
<li><strong>Jan 29: First American mid-air collision in 16 years</strong></li>
<li>Jan 30: Whitehouse addresses the nation. Donald Trump blames DEI, Joe Biden, and Barack Obama for the tragic accident.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>I don’t want to come across as crass by comparing a real-world tragedy with fiction, but I was immediately reminded of an unforgettable scene in the season 2 finale of <em>Breaking Bad</em> (spoiler warning) when we learn Jane’s father is an air traffic controller. Having just lost his daughter, he is grief-stricken and a plane crash occurs. It shows that despite Walt continuing to justify his misdeeds, our actions have severe, irreversible, and widespread consequences. Far beyond what we can fathom.</p>
<p>There will be an extensive investigation to what happened but I feel like this Reddit user put together the pieces. In the name of “government efficiency” Trump is dismantling the structures that keep us safe. Let’s not mince words: 67 people died because of Trump’s actions. As with everything else, there will be zero consequences for him.</p>
<p>As wrap up week two of Trump’s presidency I urge you to imagine the harm he will cause over the next four years.</p>
<p>(PS Matt Birchler <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/this-is-why-people-see-attacks-on-dei-as-thinly-veiled-racism/">had a great take</a> on Trump’s anti-DEI rhetoric on this, which is again, deflecting from the core issue of not respecting labor in this country. Especially in demanding and serious occupations.)</p>

			 <p>I’ll probably submit these items as “official” feedback items to Apple but in the meantime here are a few things I noticed tonight while using my beloved Apple TV running tvOS watching Apple TV+ shows. This is a platform I use <em>every night</em> and I want it to be better.</p>
<h2 id="first-some-praise">First some praise</h2>
<p>You’ve always been able to say “what did they say?” to the remote and it would rewind 10 seconds and turn on the captions for a few seconds. Incredible feature.</p>
<p>Now in tvOS 18 the same thing happens when you click the left button. No need to talk, just click.</p>
<p>It’s an <em>tiny</em> improvement but I know so many people will benefit from this, especially with shows like <em>All Creatures Great and Small</em>. The world would be a much better place if companies focused on sanding off the hard edges and just made things <em>nicer</em>.</p>
<p>(Unrelated but using a pair of HomePods with your TV is incredible. That is until it randomly loses connection. It doesn’t happen too often but it feels impossible to recover from.)</p>
<h2 id="apple-tv-plus">Apple TV Plus</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stop spoiling massive season 1 mysteries in your season 2 pre-roll promos. What is hell is wrong with you? (Referring to both <em>Silo</em> and <em>Severance</em>.)</li>
<li>You don’t need to tell me to watch shows I’m already watching.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tvos">tvOS</h2>
<ul>
<li>It’s impossible to see who directed specific episodes of a TV show. (How do I know which episodes Ben Stiller directed of <em>Severance</em>?)</li>
<li>Cast &amp; Crew should be separate rows to better highlight directors, producers, writers, costume, etc. The list of actors (especially on shows) can be endless and there’s so many <em>other</em> people that come together to make film and TV.</li>
<li>Rotten Tomatoes scores are shown for movies but not TV. First: it’s a crass way to judge art. Second: you could lose many nights to a bad show but a bad movie is… 2 hours? Third: RT offers distinct Critic and Audience scores, which can be useful.</li>
<li>This doesn’t happen often but sometimes the Match Frame Rate setting gets stuck: I’ll finish an episode and the tvOS UI will keep running at 24fps instead of buttery 60. Horrendous and hard to fix.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>This TikTok ban is complete bullshit. From everything I’ve read this is pure rah-rah anti-China. Yes TikTok is <em>100%</em> a propaganda factory and its algorithm is dangerous but so is Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.</p>
<p>If you care about the problems this ban <em>purports</em> to solve we need genuine algorithm, privacy, and data laws to protect the citizens of the U.S. of A. — which would <em>just so happen</em> to include TikTok. This of course would take down too many U.S.-based morally-bankrupt ad-tech, data broker, and social media companies. So yeah, let’s just turn a blind eye to that and let’s just focus on this one Chinese company in particular.</p>
<p>It’s also a call to action to build alternatives to the giants (projects like <a href="https://loops.video">loops.video</a> spring to mind). To all of you out there who consider yourself a “content creator”: take your videos and share them on the web. Don’t let your livelihood be subject to a single algorithm <em>that can’t control</em>.</p>
<p>As much as I despise at the term “content creator” (come on, it <em>completely</em> devalues your work) I do feel bad for these people caught in the crosshairs here. These people built an audience on TikTok and they just lost their entire network of followers. Imagine running a bakery and you had to change locations overnight but you have no means of telling your regulars — talk about putting all your breads in one basket.</p>
<p>The internet is vast and wild. Get out of the silos.</p>

<p>Forty-two years ago, for reasons beyond my comprehension, David Lynch plucked me out of obscurity to star in his first and last big budget movie. He clearly saw something in me that even I didn’t recognize. I owe my entire career, and life really, to his vision.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/91183cbb-50f9-464a-9d2e-96063825bfcf">Cristina Criddle and Hannah Murphy</a>, at the <em>Financial Times</em>, via <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/meta-ai-generated-social/">Nick Heer</a> and <a href="http://manton.micro.blog/2024/12/30/algorithmic-timeline-endgame.html">Manton Reece</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Characters generated by AI] will fill its social media platforms in the next few years … “They’ll have bios and profile pictures and be able to generate and share content powered by AI on the platform … that’s where we see all of this going,” [Meta’s Connor Hayes] added.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nick Heer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine how little you will see from the friends and family members you actually care about. Imagine how much <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/elon-musk-themed-ai-slop/">slop</a> you will be greeted with — a feed alternating between slop, suggested posts, and ads, with <em>just enough</em> of what you actually opened the app to see. Now consider how this will affect people who are more committed to Meta&rsquo;s products, whether for economic reasons or social cohesion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Facebook’s plan freaks me out because to so many people Facebook might as well be <em>The Internet</em>. They’ll just slowly boil the frog by introducing fake AI-generated <em>users</em> who are posting fake AI-generated <em>content</em> and you’ll see less of your friends and family. If you don’t think the good folks at Facebook will succeed, just replace the “AI stuff” with “ads” and you’ll see a company who has a track record of giving you less of what you want over time. People notice but don’t care <em>enough</em> to leave.</p>
<p>This idea of replacing real stuff with fake stuff reminded me of the story back in November of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24294995/spotify-ai-fake-albums-scam-distributors-metadata">Spotify slowly adding AI-slop to their top playlists</a>. Spotify will justify their actions because it <em>saves them money</em> (by decreasing how much they pay real artists) and they’ll be more profitable. Facebook will justify their actions by saying <em>it’s more engaging</em> (aka more eyeballs looking at ads). Both business models incentivize this gross behavior. So if you’re doubtful of this coming to pass, don’t be: this unwanted AI takeover will <em>absolutely</em> happen.</p>
<p>People spend so much time on these platforms and they’re just going to slowly rot to a majority of AI-slop. My concern is that the people will <strong>not revolt</strong>. They won’t vote with their feet and find a new home online. The network effects are just too strong. On a more optimistic note (it is New Years Eve, after all) my hope is that it opens the door for smaller companies like <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> who believe in a people-first web. There is a <a href="https://kagi.com/smallweb">small but mighty cohort</a> of people writing and posting to their own site and following along via RSS. The problem is it’s the absolute <em>smallest</em> minority and I believe it should be the majority.</p>

			 <p>This was a big year of change for our family: we had our first kid in May! Wild times. 7 months later and the <em>before times</em> feel like a distant memory. It’s true what they say about your life changing with kids.</p>
<p>Gaming has mostly taken a back seat to ensure evening downtime is spent with my wife.

<p><strong>Movies and TV</strong>
Here’s what I watched in quarter 4 of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finished season 2 of <em>Shrinking</em> and <em>Bad Sisters</em> on Apple. <em>Shrinking</em> is a such a wonderful heartfelt show with a fantastic season finale that had me in tears.</li>
<li>Almost done with <em>Silo</em> on Apple.</li>
<li>Rewatched <em>The Grinch</em> (with Jim Carrey) on Christmas Eve.</li>
<li>Started <em>Skeleton Crew</em> and <em>X-Men ‘97</em> on Disney.</li>
<li>All 4 seasons of <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/71737-a-p-bio"><em>A.P. Bio</em></a> with Glenn Howerton and the unforgettable <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/person/1226294-paula-pell">Paula Pell</a> on Netflix. So fun and weird.</li>
<li>The excellent <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/61859-the-night-manager"><em>The Night Manager</em></a> (2016) with Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie, and Elizabeth Debicki, and Olivia Colman on Amazon Prime. Merlin raved about this so I finally had to watch it. <em>Outstanding</em>. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/mediacentre/2024/the-night-manager-returns">BBC says it’s coming back</a> for two more seasons.</li>
<li>Rewatched all of <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/95480-slow-horses"><em>Slow Horses</em></a> on Apple with Gary Oldman. I couldn’t get my wife to watch it the first time around but my glowing review of <em>no it’s really good</em> got her hooked on it!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/194764-the-penguin"><em>The Penguin</em></a> on HBO Max with Collin Farrell and Cristin Milioti was a good time. Excited to see how it’s woven into the next Batman movie.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/147050-disclaimer"><em>Disclaimer</em></a> with Cate Blanchett on Apple was a slow burn and we kept wondering, <em>when it going to become a thriller?</em> but it gets there by the end.</li>
<li>We watched seasons 1 and 2 of <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/124101-hacks"><em>Hacks</em></a> with Jean Smart on HBO Max. Loved it! Took a break afterwards but will watch season 3 soon.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/258902-english-teacher"><em>English Teacher</em></a> with Brian Jordan Alvarez is an FX show on Hulu. We found it hilarious.</li>
<li>Season 2 of <em>The Big Door Prize</em> on Apple.</li>
<li>Season 2 of <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</em> on Amazon. Spoilers(?) but it was so obvious that “the stranger” was Gandalf. <em>Who else would it have been?</em></li>
<li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/157226-sunny"><em>Sunny</em></a> on Apple with Rashida Jones was interesting but not sure it “stuck the landing.”</li>
<li>Really enjoyed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penelope_(TV_series)"><em>Penelope</em></a> on Netflix. This caught my attention after hearing <a href="https://www.theringer.com/podcasts/the-town-with-matthew-belloni/2024/09/25/how-to-make-your-own-tv-show-and-get-netflix-to-buy-it">Mark Duplass’ interview on <em>The Town</em></a> where I learned it was self-funded <em>and</em> he retains the rights — not Netflix.</li>

			 <p>Imagine settling in at your desk for a bit of work on a cold winter’s morning when you realize your coffee has grown cold. Teeth clattering you hobble to the stove, shambling shamelessly in your threadbare sweatpants, to pour recently chilled bean water into a small pot. After a few moments of the stovetop’s hot glow this pitiful leftover coffee dribble is warmed to your satisfaction.</p>
<p>This was life in our apartment of 5 years without a microwave.</p>
<p>The place didn’t come with one and we never figured out a good place to put one. Slowly over time we began to pride ourselves in our ability to patiently warm liquids and foodstuffs with a stove. There is a certain disdain towards the microwave. Those without are quick to let you know, similar to people who brag that “don’t have a television because <em>we read</em>.”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I write these words, dear reader, because I want to share the sheer joy I have for the low-end, piano black Hotpoint microwave in our kitchen.</p>
<p>What happened? Well two years ago we moved into a house with a microwave. The magic of the “+30 seconds” button<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> brought a convenience and immediacy to warmness that we sorely missed. After having a baby the last 7 months, it’s been an absolute godsend for quickly sanitizing bottles, warming pumpkin or frozen corn, and yes, even a cup of <a href="https://media1.tenor.com/m/6Smdek4g_mcAAAAd/bebendo-caf%C3%A9-tomando-caf%C3%A9.gif">damn good coffee</a> that’s grown cold.</p>
<p>This past weekend after a long day of work and child rearing, we reached in the freezer for a quick dinner: two of <a href="https://www.amys.com/our-foods/vietnamese-banh-mi-wrap">Amy’s banh mi wraps</a>.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> This frozen delicacy’s cooking instructions, printed on its transparent plastic wrap, tells you <em>everything</em> you need to know about why I love microwaves and why I, in the ever waning days of 2024, am writing this piece:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microwave Oven: Place the wrap on a microwave-safe plate. Cover with a microwave-safe plate. Cook for <strong>1 minute</strong>. Flip. Cook for 30-45 more seconds. Let sit 1 minute. Serve.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Oven: Preheat oven to 350ºF. Remove overwrap. Wrap in foil. Bake the wrap for <strong>50-55 minutes</strong>. Let sit 1 minute. Serve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ain’t nobody got time for that shit.</p>
<p>In another life we might have waited <em>nearly an hour</em> to eat a too-small burrito-like substance. That is not the life I want for myself. It certainly is <em>not</em> the life I want for my child.</p>
<p>Thank you, microwaves.</p>

			 <p>It’s amazing to see what’s become of Notre Dame just 5 short years after it was tragically engulfed in flames. The photos of the new Notre Dame are stunning: check out the <a href="https://youtu.be/UQe4bi5PW1Y?si=Gvkww74hbgru2I31">60 Minutes video</a> or the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/05/arts/design/notre-dame-reopens-paris.html">New York Times feature</a> (via <a href="https://kottke.org/24/12/0045804-a-fantastic-interactive-f">Kottke</a>).</p>
<p>For comparison here’s a blurry photo I took in 2010 on an old Kodak V603. It was beautiful but <em>so</em> dark inside. The entire atmosphere is completely different today and is a truly unbelievable accomplishment.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been experimenting with the iOS <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-review/5/">Scheduled Summary</a> notifications feature (no, not the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24289939/apple-intelligence-ai-notification-summaries-awkward-funny-bad">AI summary thing</a>).</p>
<p>This feature has been out for a while but I just started using it a few weeks ago. I love the idea and the fun mosaic layouts are very appealing, but it’s mostly been hit or miss for me. Straight up bugs are annoying. Like sometimes notifications I dismiss from the summary will reappear in the main list <em>much later</em> so then I’m left to wonder: did this save any of my time or attention?</p>
<p>It’s also a lot of work to set up. I wish there was a “select all” when opting for which apps should be the summary. The idea that apps by default should send notifications constantly and <em>at all times</em> is insane. No wonder we are all collectively addicted to these telephones.</p>

			 <p>I heard Snell’s verbal explanation of <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2525708/the-app-store-era-must-end-apples-already-got-the-solution.html">The Mac is the Model</a> in <a href="https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/539">Upgrade 539</a> (and again in <a href="https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/540">540</a>) and couldn’t agree more with the idea that App Store plus a hands-off notarization is the way forward for iOS. Apple constructed an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appdistribution/distributing-your-app-on-an-alternative-marketplace">intentionally over-complicated cockamamie system</a> to “comply” with the EU. It’s a mess. They’ve <a href="https://mastodon.social/@maczydeco/113527850662678715">already abused</a> their gatekeeping position and shown they can’t help themselves. They need to let go.</p>
<p>These things we call “phones” are actually just computers. They’re crazy good computers. So Apple, please just let them be <em>computers</em>. Let developers write apps and let anyone download them from the web. Most customers and the big apps<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> will stay in the App Store because it’s easy and gives them peace of mind. This is not rocket science and regular people will figure it out.</p>
<p>I knew Steve Jobs said something to the effect of “people are smart”. Via <a href="https://www.inc.com/melanie-curtin/33-steve-jobs-quotes-that-will-inspire-you-to-achieve-massive-success.html">Inc</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Technology is nothing. What&rsquo;s important is that you have a faith in people, that they&rsquo;re basically good and smart, and if you give them tools, they&rsquo;ll do wonderful things with them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you first start off trying to solve a problem, the first solutions you come up with are very complex, and most people stop there…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems like that’s how Apple got to the current Alternative Marketplace craziness. It continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…But if you keep going, and live with the problem and peel more layers of the onion off, you can oftentimes arrive at some very elegant and simple solutions. Most people just don&rsquo;t put in the time or energy to get there. We believe that customers are smart, and want objects which are well thought through.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I genuinely feel they must be embarrassed by how the Mac works. Or they are too proud to make a system in 2024 that has the simplicity of the Mac’s model.</p>
<p>Apple’s arrogance in this case lead them to believe the <em>complex</em> solution was the <em>correct</em> one. Letting people just download apps from the web is simple. It’s better for customers. It’s worse for Apple because it cedes control and risks losing a bit of money while dousing developer goodwill with gasoline.</p>
<p>What I expect in 2025 are more countries doing their spin on the EU’s DMA and cutting straight to the punchline: require Mac-like app downloading on iOS. Done.</p>

<p>There is the fear that Facebook would pull out of the store and effectively turn the apps to full-on spyware. Of course we need to remember their apps are already semi-spyware.

			 <p>Last night my parents told me a fun story that I wanted to relay to the world:</p>
<p>My parents spent this past Easter with friends. Before brunch was served the host asked everyone to hold hands for a blessing. Once the table settled in, hand in hand with closed eyes, the host began to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. My parents peeked to scan the room to assess <em>were they for real?</em> while the group quietly recited along with the host. When it was over the group started eating. The moment passed.</p>
<p>Months later the host (a huge wiseass) told my parents it had been a prank. The entire table was in on the joke. They all too it so seriously and didn’t break <em>at all</em> and intentionally waited months to reveal this fact — just to play it cool.</p>
<p>Kudos to them for playing such a well executed, and harmless, prank. It works on <em>so</em> many levels but since my parents were the only non-family members how would they know this <em>wasn’t</em> a legitimate tradition in this household? It also worked because they knew my parents wouldn’t want to ask in the moment. It could have been considered unpatriotic or worse, rude, to question someone another family’s rituals.</p>
<p>The kicker is that as they told me this story, I interrupted them immediately. “Oh, just like <em>Christmas Vacation</em>?” A movie we’ve all watched dozens of times over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aoj5qIZvwWA?si=MZYZTopSYgvdW-__">That moment</a> is seared into my brain and the lines leading up to it like, “Grace? She died over 30 years ago” live in brain rent free.</p>
<p>Tonight, gathered around the Thanksgiving table, my dad offered to say grace. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pledge_of_Allegiance#Recital">These were his words</a>. He was not questioned.</p>
<hr>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving everyone, and to all a good night. 🦃</p>

			 <p>After months of listening to Manton Reece on <a href="https://coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a> I’ve decided to move to <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>. My domain name will carry on but I’m not 100% sure if my RSS feed will transition gracefully? 🤷 Worst case I’ll let all 12 of you know with a final post in this feed.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>My current site is built with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> and while I’ve enjoyed the experience of learning web development and entering the world of static site generators, I find there’s just too much friction with writing new posts — especially from my phone.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> It’s enough friction where I tend to just post to Mastodon or sit on a pile of unused ideas for months.</p>
<p>In this process I’ve learned that I enjoy writing. I like even more that I’m writing at a domain and site I control — not some out-of-his-mind billionaire. What drew me to Eleventy was the idea that I could mooch indefinitely off of GitHub pages (free!) and only pay for my domain renewal fees. Unfortunately the convenience is just not there.</p>
<p>Enter Micro.blog which hosts your site, lets you blog, cross-post to Threads and Mastodon (and others), and podcast hosting (you never know!) for <a href="https://micro.blog/pricing">$5/mo</a>. I always have this fear of thinking of monthly costs for my website, which often goes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I want to have a website my whole life that’s… hmm let me do the math… $5 × 12 months per year × 90 years. Shit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the reality is that $5/mo is, at least for most people, nothing. This is “cup of coffee” territory.</p>
<p>Micro.blog also has a social aspect, but without all the algorithms and engagement bait that makes using Threads or certain <em>unnamed</em> sites such a hellscape at times. I want to take this as an opportunity to rethink my relationship with social media more broadly.</p>
<p>I’m pumped to try Micro.blog and I can already tell I’m going to be a happy paying customer. We need more people like Manton building platforms based on the open web and I’m happy to support their work over there. Write on!</p>

			 <p>Dan Moren <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/11/m4-mac-mini-review-phenomenal-cosmic-power-itty-bitty-form-factor/">writing about the new Mac mini</a> with M4 and M4 Pro, writing at Six Colors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… it&rsquo;s basically a smaller version of the Mac Studio, which was itself a taller version of the Mac mini. Time, as they say, is a flat squircle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dan Moren cracks me up.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I’m certainly tempted by the new Mac mini. I have a great desktop setup — two displays, continuity camera, great speakers — but the brains are a MacBook Pro (M1 Pro) in clamshell. It’s a great machine but you can always use faster when doing SwiftUI development.</p>
<p>I’d love a machine that’s always ready for me at the desk but my hangup is: do I really need two Macs? I feel like if I get the mini I need to trade in my laptop. There are times I want a Mac to-go though and Apple silicon MacBooks have almost zero compromises.</p>
<p>The correct decision is to <em>not buy anything</em>. We shall see.</p>

			 <p>I heard Nvidia overtook Apple as the most valuable company in the world today. Their insane growth has been driven by the need for GPUs to build data centers and models for companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta.</p>
<p>What I find interesting is that the CEO of Anthropic, Dario Amodei, <a href="https://darioamodei.com/machines-of-loving-grace">wrote an essay</a> where he stated that the next generation of AI will take somewhere around $100 billion to create. That’s a <em>lot</em> of money and it’s difficult to see the path from iterating on LLMs to get to &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo;. One very likely possibility is that companies like OpenAI run themselves into the ground chasing this fantasy.</p>
<p>All along the way, Nvidia will happily take their cash <strong>today</strong> selling GPUs who may go out in a burning blaze of glory burning the cash and energy to make the AI of <strong>tomorrow</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Regardless on your feelings of AI<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, you gotta hand it to Nvidia for leaning into this and being a critical ingredient for all these companies: they’ll be the one left holding the bag.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Despite Coldplay’s new album <em>Moon Music</em> not coming out until Friday, I found a way to listen to it.</p>
<p>In a world where many people tune into endless playlists and mindless lo-fi music on YouTube, I’m an old school album guy. I love discovering new music but I can’t latch onto an artist without sinking my teeth into an album or an EP. The <em>album</em> is a work of art: What is its mood? What does this collection of songs in this particular order say about the people who made it and the time in which it’s made?</p>
<p>One of the things I’ve always appreciated about Coldplay is their dedication to the album. It’s certain to be a commercially-driven strategy: the duration between albums, time spent on tour, and how long they drip and hype a new release is like clockwork. Each album is an era which its own unique art style, show, and through line.</p>
<p>That brings me to <em>Moon Music</em> (which is Coldplay’s second collaboration with Max Martin and billed as a follow-up to <em>Music of the Spheres</em>) which has a semblance of continuity, hung together loosely with what I would call <em>spacey</em> sounds and (like 99% of pop music) simple ideas about love.</p>
<p>Here are my thoughts after a first listen.</p>
<p>(Listen to this album with some good headphones, you’ll thank me later.)</p>
<hr>
<p>It begins with a gorgeous intro, the titular <em>Moon Music</em>, from Jon Hopkins. To my knowledge it’s the first time he’s been credited as a “featuring…” on a Coldplay track (as opposed to being relegated to liner notes) but he’s worked with Coldplay as far back as 2008’s opening track on <em>Viva La Vida</em>. The opener here too is absolutely brilliant and I was completely lost in it.</p>
<p><em>Feelslikeimfallinginlove</em> has a strange combination of having energy — especially in the chorus — while being a slow, low-key rhythmic vibe. It was a solid choice for a lead single.</p>
<p><em>We Pray</em> is a more successful version of <em>Princess of China</em> with Rihanna, or <em>Hymn for the Weekend</em> with Beyoncé. I don’t know the artists featured but I enjoy how <em>different</em> this song feels and it has definitely grown on me.</p>
<p><em>Jupiter</em> is an absolute joy that fills your heart with an upbeat message. Ya gotta love the acoustic guitar and cello.</p>
<p><em>Good Feelings</em> with Arya Starr is a funky good time with a stellar guitar riff halfway in. It sounds like it could have been on Daft Punk’s <em>Random Access Memories</em> or on a Passion Pit record.</p>
<p><em>Rainbow</em> is filled with dreamy synths, ripping guitar, a beautiful piano interlude, and spoken audio from Maya Angelou reminds me of M83’s <em>Hurry Up We’re Dreaming</em>.</p>
<p><em>Iaam</em> (“I Am a Mountain”) is like a throwback to <em>Glass of Water</em> from 2009 but without the heart. The mix itself is hollow: tonally, lyrically, and energy. It stays at one level the whole time.</p>
<p><em>Aeterna</em> is a groovy tune my brother. I’m looking forward to hearing <em>many</em> remixes that take this jam to full-on EDM music. Nice vocal outro too. (I think they played this live at Glastonbury and it looked like a rockin’ time.)</p>
<p><em>All My Love</em> is a classic, piano-centric Coldplay love song with a great string ensemble. It feels like this song has been in the air forever yet is somehow new. (Reminds me of their demo of <em>Wedding Bells</em> many moons ago.) I wanna sit down at the piano and learn it.</p>
<p><em>One World</em> has vamping synths, piano, guitar which fall away to a hundred humming voices then trails to <em>another</em> breathtaking string piece. Some Pink Floyd vibes at the very beginning then goes straight to M83 for its crescendo.</p>
<p>(The outro had me wondering if they forgot to come back and record the words — but there’s also something charming in its rawness.)</p>
<hr>
<p>There’s a lot of variety in <em>Moon Music</em> and a lot to like. Musically there are some <strong>incredible</strong> moments, especially in the more complex instrumental compositions. Lyrically it left me wanting with two too many songs rely on “la la la” as a chorus.</p>
<p>As a continuous listening experience, it moves nicely throughout but there’s an unevenness. (The incongruity from <em>We Pray</em> to <em>Jupiter</em> is a bit of whiplash.)</p>
<p>To be sure, there is some beautiful music here (if you like Coldplay) but time will tell if this is a good <em>album</em> that stands out in the annals of time like <em>Viva la Vida</em>. Maybe by my tenth listen I can check back in.</p>
<p>My first listen was laying in bed with headphones and I’m looking forward to hearing it on my speakers tomorrow for a totally different listening experience.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://seths.blog/2024/09/twenty-questions/">Seth Godin’s 20 Questions</a> post has some good considerations for starting a new project. I think it’s mostly in the context of consulting but I’ve been thinking about this as a solo app developer.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I have an idea for a simple (in theory) app but I’ve been having a hard time deciding if I should even start it or not. I haven’t yet had the time or skills to make MapKeep fully featured and I feel like I’d be leaving it unfinished. At best my time would now be split between two apps (and all my other interests, such as my child and gaming).</p>
<p>The upside of starting this new idea? It <em>could</em> have a broader appeal than MapKeep and I think more likely to made some <strong>coin</strong>. (That’s not my main goal but it’s always in the back of my capitalistic mind.)</p>
<p>Big picture is I often wonder how others seem to juggle so many projects and I feel like I can’t measure up to them. Erving Goffman would say something like <em>don’t compare someone else’s frontstage to your backstage</em>.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://spyglass.org/apple-knew-where-the-puck-was-going-but-meta-skated-there/">M.G. Siegler tosses out a few interesting ideas</a> for how Apple Vision Pro could be re-envisioned as accessory to the iPhone. Let the iPhone be the brains and the battery for headset and have <em>that</em> be the tethered thing (instead of that jumbo battery).</p>
<p>The hole there is that ultra low-latency for passthrough mode is essential so people don’t get motion sick (and so you could play ping pong) while wearing it. Maybe that could have been solved to some degree, but I assume the physical proximity from silicon to display is a key factor.</p>
<p>Overall I like spitballing on “what if” scenarios for Apple Vision Pro successors and Siegler has some good points. I am intrigued by products like the <a href="https://www.xreal.com/us/">XREAL</a> glasses for projecting my Switch or iPhone and less keen on an entire new computing platform.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Thanks to Louie Mantia for his <a href="https://lmnt.me/blog/dark-mode-app-icons.html">dark mode app icons blog post</a>. He inspired me to use a sunset in the background (as opposed to Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons#iOS-iPadOS">default gradient</a>) which strikes a nice balance between fitting in and standing out.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been busy with making a few substantial updates to MapKeep this summer so I avoided touching the betas. The main item on my todo list is supporting the new app icon tinting and I’m glad I waited. It’s great seeing what many apps have done, courtesy of the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-18-the-macstories-review/3/">App Icon chapter</a> in Federico Viticci’s iOS 18 review. Now I have some fresh ideas and hope to release something in the next week or so.</p>
<p><em>Update September 20, 2024:</em> After using iOS 18 more I’ve noticed how glaring apps look that don&rsquo;t support the new icon styles. It’s not for me, at least not yet, but it shines a big light on apps that don&rsquo;t update. Some will translate just fine but more colorful icons like NetNewsWire and my own just get lazily darkened by 20%. iOS 13, when Dark Mode was introduced, was not <strong>this</strong> noticeable: now without even opening apps you can see which apps have done the work and which haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don’t begrudge Apple with how they rolled this out, just an observation.</p>

Without <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/maintaining-a-local-copy-of-server-data">Apple’s DataCache</a> sample project, there is <em>zero</em> chance I would have figured this out. iOS 18 appears to improve predicates, but I’ve yet to jump on the latest here to see if it would have made things smoother.</li>
<li><strong>iCloud Sharing</strong> is not supported. I was disappointed to learn this last summer but I figured: hey SwiftData is brand-new, I’m sure they’ll get to it next year. Well here we are a year later and they <strong>did not</strong> add iCloud Sharing in iOS 18. Now we wait for WWDC 2025?</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>By contrast, going all-in with SwiftUI last year worked out great. There were a few headaches and a couple things that were <em>impossible</em> to customize, but altogether I feel like it’s a mature UI system (at least on iOS and watchOS).</p>
<p>I’m sitting here feeling I might have been better off sticking with tried-and-true CoreData and <em>eventually</em> migrating to SwiftData when it felt more fully-baked.</p>

			 <p>I launched an update to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833">MapKeep</a> this weekend which brings an all-new design. It has a list and map that stay in sync: selecting something on the map shows it in the list. Date filters are also improved.</p>
<p>The previous design was all-map which made it nice to <em>view</em> your collection but difficult to <em>explore</em> your locations chronologically. The app has been out for almost a year now so I wanted to make sure it could handle large collections.</p>
<p>I debated calling this “Version 2.0” because it was effectively a <strong>full rewrite</strong> of the iPhone app and brought a substantially new experience. However, from a user’s standpoint: this basically just adds a list! So I’ll hold onto that for a bit longer.</p>

<p>I’m sure there’s something in your life that you’d like to track easily. So <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833">check out MapKeep</a>. (It’s free!)</p>
<p>For inspiration: here’s a couple real world examples of how it’s used:</p>
<ul>
<li>A friend of mine moved to a new city and they capture spots in town (parks, neighborhoods, restaurants) to come back to later.</li>
<li>A family member wants to use it anytime they get a birdie on the golf course to mark the occasion.</li>
<li>Tracking where your dog does a number 2 on walks ;-)</li>

			 <p>I don’t have a fully formed opinion on how much of what Suno’s tools are just traditional “remixing” or sampling but this sentiment expressed in <a href="https://suno.com/blog/future-of-music">their blog post</a> as a response to their RIAA lawsuit is ridiculous:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… like the kid writing their own rock songs after listening to the genre … learning is not infringing. It never has been, and it is not now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s obvious what the difference is, right? One is a computer absorbing millions of songs and one is a <strong>human</strong>. Computers don’t have rights.</p>
<p>They also justify their actions by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We train our models on … music we can find on the open internet &ndash; just as Google&rsquo;s Gemini, Microsoft&rsquo;s Copilot, Anthropic&rsquo;s Claude, OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT, and even Apple&rsquo;s new Apple Intelligence train their models on the open internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is akin to a toddler saying, “the other kids are doing it, why am <em>I</em> in trouble?”</p>
<p>I am not pro- Big Record Label. I want people to make music and I bet Suno’s tools are neat but these are kid-level logical arguments that don’t hold water. I look forward to seeing what happens next.</p>

			 <p>I learned about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/31/24210304/wix-ai-website-builder-seo-blog-posts">Wix’s new blog-writing tools</a> thanks to a post by Jess Weatherbed at The Verge.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> This will enable <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/11/style/ai-search-slop.html">slop</a> at massive scale. Heaps of garbage written by a machine to <em>hopefully</em> appease Google’s algorithms and trick people into thinking this site is written by another human. Wix’s large presence in the webhosting world means this has the potential to be an all-out assault on a human-led internet. I hope they reconsider this endeavor.</p>
<p>On a similar note:</p>
<p>My wife, who’s far less tuned-in to the AI-hype world than me, was equally grossed-out by <a href="https://youtu.be/NgtHJKn0Mck?si=NBFRh2Qlt7duUFab">Google’s ad during the Olympics</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> where a father encourages his child to use Gemini to <em>write a letter to their hero</em>.</p>
<p>How would you feel if you found out a disingenuous robot wrote a “heartfelt” letter to you?</p>
<p>Luckily we <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/30/nx-s1-5056201/google-olympics-ai-ad">weren’t the only people</a> who picked up on this detail and it went viral (in a bad way). Similar to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntjkwIXWtrc">Apple’s <em>Crush</em> ad</a>, I struggle to understand how this ad made it into the world. Did no one at these companies raise their hand to say, “Isn’t this gross?”</p>
<p>Upon seeing Apple’s Image Playgrounds at WWDC the same word came to mind: <em>gross</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh it looks like you made a lovely hand drawn sketch of a building? Let’s turn it to a super-fake, oversaturated, clearly-made-by-a-computer-abomination with one easy tap!</li>
<li>Want a hyper-ugly-Pixar knockoff of your mom? Bon appétit.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>I worry, <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected/509">as others do</a>, that if we let machines create for us we’ll never learn how to create for ourselves. <strong>I</strong> write to become a <em>better writer</em> and to share <em>my</em> thoughts.</p>
<p>To clarify: I’m not against AI in its entirety. I’m not happy that every LLM-maker decided they could violate copyright and scrape the whole web. I’m concerned that more companies like <a href="https://tidbits.com/2024/07/29/reddit-blocks-indexing-by-search-engines-other-than-google/">Reddit will withdraw from searched indexes unless paid</a>.</p>
<p>But I do think AI can be uniquely talented at <em>editing</em>. Someone who’s over my shoulder and can suggest ways to elevate my work, connect it to other things, and make me more efficient. Apple’s Writing Tools (if they work) skate the razor-thin line between creating and editing. The litmus test, I feel, is that they only ever make your text <em>shorter</em>, never <em>longer</em>.</p>
<p>To all the companies out there working on half-assed AI integrations: please redirect your focus to editing. Empower humans to be creative. Don’t fill the world with slop. I’m open to applauding and adopting AI but they have to help me. Not try to be me.</p>

			 <p>As a listener (and supporting <a href="https://atp.fm/join">member</a>) of <a href="https://atp.fm/">Accidental Tech Podcast</a> I’ve been hearing about Overcast’s big rewrite for a while now.</p>
<p>On its 10th Anniversary the big update for <a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a> is finally here! <a href="https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite">Marco</a> did an amazing job modernizing the app’s design while setting the foundation for faster feature updates in the future. I’m excited to see where it goes from here.</p>
<p>My favorite new feature is one I’ve requested: Sleep Timer can be set to <em>End of Chapter</em>. I can now drift off to sleep and not miss the beginning of the next topic.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in app development I encourage you to listen to <a href="https://www.relay.fm/radar/297">Under the Radar 297</a> or <a href="https://atp.fm/596">ATP 596</a>. There were a few tidbits that stood out to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="https://www.relay.fm/radar/293">Radar 293</a> Marco shared that a project manager helped him plan, prioritize, sequence, and define the scope for this project. It reminds me that even a team of one can benefit from a good project manager.</li>
<li>I don’t know Marco personally but it was <em>gut-wrenching</em> to hear that the burden of this rewrite (and his mountain of technical debt) made Marco consider quitting programming altogether. It was equally <em>inspiring</em> to hear he’s now feeling better than ever and ready for what’s next.</li>
<li>He migrated user data to an all-new backend in parallel (APFS style) with the <em>previous</em> version of the app to make the transition seamless for customers day one (and to lighten the server load).</li>
<li>He removed streaming (used by about 8% of users) due to increased complexity in how podcast files are hosted (namely: dynamic ad insertion). The downside isn’t huge: just a few extra seconds to wait after hitting play (if you don’t use automatic downloads). Upside: Marco won’t be burdened with bugs and can spend more time improving the app.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use the app I encourage you to leave a nice review (or a quick 5 star rating) for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/overcast/id888422857">Overcast in the App Store</a>. A nice review goes a long way and it pays dividends to send good vibes.</p>

			 <p>I took advantage of the long Fourth of July weekend to work on <a href="/mapkeep/">MapKeep</a>. Don&rsquo;t worry: I was able to enjoy the beautiful weather from our back porch. I shipped <a href="/2024/05/12/mapkeep.html">version 1.2</a> <em>right</em> before our daughter was born but since then we haven&rsquo;t had the <del>time</del> brain power to do side projects. I’m testing an all-new design inspired by Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/icloud/find-my/">Find My</a> which should unlock some new interactions (and expand to iPadOS/macOS).</p>
<p><del>Sadly</del> I’ve taken this as an opportunity to completely rewrite the app. I’ve learned <em>a lot</em> since last summer. For example, I couldn’t figure how to get SwiftUI Previews working in my main view because it needed a fake array of SwiftData objects. Well I took the time to <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftdata/how-to-use-swiftdata-in-swiftui-previews">figure that out</a> (thanks to Paul Hudson) and now I can iterate way faster. There’s a <strong>ton</strong> of optimizations like this that add up.</p>
<p>I’m not sure this new design is a slam dunk: I&rsquo;m trying to get a feel for it by using it daily. Even if I revert to the old design the code will be in a <em>much</em> better place.</p>
<p>Tinkering with a new design is a fun distraction :-) but I probably should be thinking about iOS 18 features like <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons#Platform-considerations">Dark Mode app icons</a> and App Intents<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> ahead of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppIntents/Integrating-your-app-with-siri-and-apple-intelligence">Apple Intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>As a newbie app developer I hit a <strong>lot</strong> of brick walls. It can be truly frustrating. But when I figure it out, it feels like flying.</p>

			 <p>I <a href="/2024/06/04/becoming-a-dad.html">became a dad</a> in May. You could say it’s been a pretty big couple months. I’ll <em>never</em> forget that feeling of the first time I held her.</p>
<p>April was a nesting and prepping month, May was a monumental adjustment: waking up every two hours to help feed and change the baby was a <em>bit</em> taxing on the old noggin. As June rolled in the nights started getting easier and easier. I had a month off from work and will take more time in the Fall when my partner’s leave concludes. (I’m bitterly jealous of my German colleagues with 1 or 2 year parental leave options. I’m also grateful we get anything at all.)</p>
<p>Here’s a few bits of media I squeezed in. As you can see it’s quite a bit less than <a href="/2024/03/31/q-update.html">Q1</a>!</p>
<h2 id="games">Games</h2>
<p>My relationship with gaming is probably going to look a lot different going forward now that I have a kid: you rarely have two hands free for a controller with a newborn (let alone the time). I’m so glad my phone can be a Pokémon machine now and being able to steal a few minutes away or play one-handed while I hold my sleeping kid is such a joy.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m almost done playing through <em>Pokémon Crystal</em> (well, technically <a href="https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal">Polished Crystal</a>) in Delta and have published a couple <a href="https://deltastyles.com/user/92-andrewhaglund">custom controller skins</a>. Having a go-to game on your phone is a sure-fire way to stay off social media.</li>
<li>Played a little of <em>Hades 2</em> in early access (it’s phenomenal) on my Steam Deck and am looking forward to diving in again.</li>
<li>I picked up <em>Paper Mario: Thousand Year Door</em> remake for the Switch and have been slowly working my way through it. (For context I just stared Chapter 1.) I played the original a long time ago and have fond memories.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@haglund/112559467713943204">modded my Gamesir G8 controller</a> to work with my new iPad. It’s a glorious combination.</p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>Been enjoying new music from Vampire Weekend, Iron &amp; Wine, Hovvdy, Decemberists, Billie Eilish, and of course Taylor Swift.</p>
<p>Looking forward to new Bright Eyes and Coldplay in Q3. Speaking of Coldplay: I think they played <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kr82k58qqo">their best concert ever at Glastonbury</a>. It was an incredibly special performance with a lot of heart. Knowing 100k people were there in-person seeing what I was seeing at the <em>exact save time</em> was awe-inspiring.</p>
<h2 id="movies--tv">Movies &amp; TV</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Bad Batch</em> (season 3) went out with a bang. Love a good star war.</li>
<li><em>30 Rock</em> (seasons 1–3) is sublime. To me it’s like a live-action cartoon and I am always here for the zaniness. Blink and you might miss three jokes. I just love Tracy Morgan, Jack McBrayer, and <em>everyone</em> in the cast. (Some jokes haven’t aged well but that’s kind of how comedy works.) ★</li>
<li>My wife is rewatching <em>Modern Family</em> and I’ll catch a few episodes here and there. Holy hell. That show deserve all its Emmys, it’s such a treat.</li>
<li><em>Fargo</em> (season 3) was good but nothing like seasons 1 and 2 (which were <em>outstanding</em>). We watched an episode of season 4 and kinda bailed on it. I like <em>Fargo</em> for the relatable characters — not the organized crime.</li>
<li>The last season of <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em> (season 12) was fantastic. They nailed the finale. Pretty, <em>pretty</em> good.</li>
<li><em>Chernobyl</em> (2019) was a rewatch for me. My wife never saw it and I was itching to rewatch it. It’s an amazing feat of film and one of the all-time greats.</li>
<li><em>Demetri Martin: Demetri Deconstructed</em> was humorous and surreal. Interesting editing and pacing of a live standup session.</li>
<li><em>BlackBerry</em> was excellent and such a funny and amazing “true story” movie. It makes you realize how far our current technology has come (and how amazing the iPhone is). I’d love to see Glenn Howerton in more serious roles going forward. ★</li>
<li><em>Dream Scenario</em> was a classic A24 film and Nic Cage was great. While I liked it I couldn’t help but think that I was just watching an extended version of the trailer. It’s all in there, weirdly enough.</li>
<li><em>Conan O’Brien Must Go</em> was a great laugh. Always been a fan of him and it’s fun seeing him have fun. ★</li>
<li><em>Little Women</em> (2019) was great. I’m not sure why we watched this now — it might have been suggested in Hulu or something — but it’s a delightful movie. I was in a stage adaptation of this in high school (I can’t remember who I played) so I’ll always have a soft spot for this tale. (It was also interesting watching this after seeing <em>Barbie</em> since it was Gerwig’s previous project.)</li>
<li><em>Castle in the Sky</em> is a masterpiece. Watching this made me realize how much <em>Zelda</em> borrows from Ghibli’s humor and style — everything from the nature, creatures, music, and floating cities were all just sitting there.</li>
<li><em>Unfrosted</em> felt like an odd halfway between a kid’s movie and something for older audience. Not sure who this movie was for…? Just a big sugar-high mess of cameos. (Jack McBrayer and the <em>Mad Men</em> scene make it worthwhile in my book.) If this didn’t have Seinfeld attached there’s no way I would have watched it.</li>
<li><em>Clueless</em> (1995) I <em>think</em> I had seen this once before but not sure. It was a fine romcom. Not sure how Paul Rudd still looks the same.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>MacRumors has a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/07/apple-intelligence-service-wwdc/">roundup of AI features</a> expected to be announced by Apple on Monday during the WWDC 2024 keynote. There’s a lot of buzz around AI (especially in the stock market where Nvidia is <a href="https://spyglass.org/nvidia-3-trillion/">suddenly valued</a> around $3 trillion which is in within spitting distance of Apple and Microsoft, two companies which make <em>way</em> more money).</p>
<p>There’s an over-abundance of hype and I expect there to be quite the comedown when this bubble bursts. Recent mainstream events like <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/20/1252495087/openai-pulls-ai-voice-that-was-compared-to-scarlett-johansson-in-the-movie-her">Scarlett Johansson’s kerfuffle with OpenAI</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd11gzejgz4o">Google telling people to eat rocks and glue</a> put a spotlight on the ethical and technical issues with AI technology and the companies hawking these new-fangled products.</p>
<p>Putting that aside for a moment, I am extremely optimistic for what Apple can bring to this space. I enjoy talking with ChatGPT via voice (and subsequent fact checking it) and using it to help me code but I think AI will remain a party trick until it’s fully embedded in our phones and computers.</p>
<p>Things like the Apple Photos widget and iOS 17’s autocorrect <em>are already AI</em> and I think there’s hundreds of ways that AI could help us get things done on our computers in new and faster ways. So count me in as someone who is very excited to see what we’ll get on Monday.</p>
<p>But don’t get <em>too</em> excited. I think iOS 18 will just be the start of a long journey to incorporate these new technologies into our operating systems. I think we’re going to be surprised and impressed come Monday but also let down. Both things can be true. There’s too much hype and anticipation for Apple to solve everything in one year.</p>

			 <p>Our new car has wired CarPlay. That may sound like a crime against humanity in 2024 but I actually prefer it over wireless (mostly). A cable means it is <em>absolutely</em> rock solid and straightforward to switch between devices.</p>
<p>However I have a USB-C iPhone and my wife has a absolute garbage antiquated Lighting iPhone (jk it’s a one-year-old iPhone 14). This posed an issue where we’d need to swap cables when we switched drivers in the car. I also didn’t like the idea of wearing out the car’s built in USB plug switching cables frequently. Is that an irrational thing to worry about? Yes.</p>
<p>So the solution we landed on is keeping a USB-C cable always plugged into the car for my phone. (I drive most often, especially now that we have a <a href="/2024/06/04/becoming-a-dad.html">baby</a> my wife likes to sit in the back now) and when she needs to plug in we attach this tiny <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0BRV6LWYN?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title">female USB-C to male Lightning dingus</a> to the end of the USB-C cable and voilà her phone is charging and connected to CarPlay. I was worried this cable would only handle charging bht it definitely works for tranferring the data required for CarPlay. This solution also keeps the console less cluttered — we don’t need two 3 foot cables strewn about getting tangled and driving me nuts.</p>
<p>I’m probably going to buy another to charge my keyboard at my desk. I like having an open USB-C cable at all times for charging things and I still have a few Lightning accessories. Slowly yet surely we are eradicating Lightning from our home. It’s a battle I’m ready to endure for as long as it shall take.</p>

			 <p>A few weeks ago I became a father.</p>
<p>I can’t begin to explain how wonderful it was hearing our baby’s cry for the first time. Compared to the work my wife put in, I was just a lowly bystander but I can confidently say bringing a kid into this world is a stressful proposition — the 9 months of pregnancy, the hospital stay, labor, all of it — but it all just <em>melts away</em> when you hear that baby cry and it’s you and your partner and this beautiful tiny thing.</p>
<p>In a flash everything changes and you’re filled to the absolute brim with overwhelming joy.</p>
<p>My wife’s parents and my parents and brother came to the hospital the day after to meet our baby. We couldn’t be more lucky to have their love and support. I’m on cusp of returning to work but in the past few weeks we’ve established a decent rhythm and am starting to get more sleep.</p>
<p>It’s absolutely true what they say about the first couple weeks. It was hard running on scraps of sleep and having the day sliced into two-hour increments. Even now that feels like a hazy memory. You just stay calm, sleep when they sleep, and soak it all in.</p>
<p>The three of us are doing great and we’ve been bombarded with visitors, FaceTime calls, and gifts from close friends and family. Most crucially our neighbor graciously bought us a two weeks of <a href="https://www.daily-harvest.com">meal subscription food</a> to make <em>our</em> feedings as smooth as possible.</p>
<p>I’m the absolute luckiest and I can’t wait to see who our kid becomes.</p>
<p>To close things out, here’s a quote my wife printed (and framed in the kid’s nursery) from our favorite author, Kurt Vonnegut:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello babies. Welcome to Earth. It’s hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It’s round and wet and crowded. On the outside, babies, you’ve got a hundred years here. There’s only one rule that I know of, babies — “God damn it, you’ve got to be kind.”</p>

			<h1><a href="https://haglund.app/2024/05/28/the-trials-and.html">The Trials and Tribulations of Creating Delta Skins on iPadOS</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://haglund.app/2024/05/28/the-trials-and.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-05-28 19:00:00 -0500">May 28, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I decided to work on <a href="https://github.com/AndrewHaglund/delta-absorb">Absorb</a>, my <a href="https://noah978.gitbook.io/delta-docs/skins">custom Gameboy skin</a> for the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688">Delta emulator</a>, from my shiny new 11-inch iPad Pro. There’s been a lot of conversation around what the iPad can and cannot do so I thought I’d give this a try. This is <em>fairly</em> complex work involving designing in Figma, editing JSON files, managing files, and committing code to GitHub. Let’s see how the experiment went.</p>
<h2 id="figma">Figma</h2>
<p>Designing in Figma on iPadOS is a bit of a cluster. Their marketing claims it works great in “any browser” but apparently that generous definition does not extend to Safari for iPad. If you use it directly in the browser you get weird behavior. For example, pinching with your fingers will zoom the canvas where pinching on a trackpad will zoom the entire web page. There is <a href="https://figurative.design/">Figurative</a> but this has its own tradeoffs: if I left and came back it would force reload the file because it was “out of memory” and irritatingly ⌘c and ⌘v don’t work. Generally it felt like wearing mittens — the iPadOS cursor is great but it still feels like a small meaty pointer and not the precise pointer you find on macOS.</p>
<p>Critically dealing with custom fonts is a mess on iPadOS. <a href="https://blog.iconfactory.com/2020/06/introducing-fontcase/">Fontcase</a> by the Iconfactory folks is great but it lives within Apple’s barbaric iPadOS font system. I used <a href="https://developer.apple.com/fonts/">SF Pro Rounded</a> for my button labels and I completely bailed on trying to get this onto iPad. Apple provides these fonts in a macOS Installer within a <code>.dmg</code> file, which is to decidedly <em>not</em> iPadOS-friendly. How does Figma handle missing fonts? Well by making text uneditable. Fun.</p>
<p>Exporting PDFs out of Figma into the Files app worked great and I was able to get a lot of design work done from my iPad. It was slow-going and the font issue ultimately drove me back to the Mac.</p>
<p>I have an itch to try making a Figma plugin to make it super easy to create Delta skins. That’s for another day though.</p>
<h2 id="editing-json">Editing JSON</h2>
<p>Delta’s skin system is pretty straightforward. You provide PDFs of the UI your users will see and then give the coordinates of all the buttons in a JSON file. This mapping can get unwieldy though as each device and orientation is all within a single JSON file. (It would be kind of nice if each PDF had its own JSON to make these files way more manageable.)</p>
<p>On the Mac and other desktop platforms there’s VS Code for code editing and committing code to GitHub. It’s fantastic. It has a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM4Vhrk4irY">sticky scrolling</a> feature which means you don’t lose your context. Even still it can be a pain doing all this text entry and all too often I’d forget a <code>,</code> or a <code>:</code> and everything would break!</p>
<p>VS Code is nowhere to be found on iPadOS and I could not find a text editor for iPad that had this sticky scrolling feature… but I ran into Simon Støvring’s <a href="https://jayson.app">Jayson</a> (ha) app for editing JSON files with a GUI. This is far more approachable as you no longer need to think of the syntax for JSON and making a mistake. But it also involved a lot of navigating in-and-out due to the hierarchy of Delta’s skin system (where you have to drill into <code>dictionary 0</code> to see it’s the “A” button then back out to adjust its coordinates). Using this was better than typing manually, for sure, but I think there’s a lot of opportunity for Simon to optimize this app for fewer clicks and faster navigating up-and-down the hierarchy.</p>
<p>This app is also available on macOS but it’s a bare-minimum Catalyst version of the iPad app. (Sorry if I sound negative! I’m glad it exists on macOS but this was a rare case where the superior experience was definitely on iPad.)</p>
<p>This part of the process is a huge fun suck but that’s not the iPad’s fault.</p>
<h2 id="managing-files">Managing Files</h2>
<p>Technically a Delta skin is just a renamed ZIP file of a JSON file and some PDFs. I downloaded a <a href="https://noah978.gitbook.io/delta-docs/skins">template</a> to get started, exported my designs as PDFs from Figma to the Files app, edited the JSON file in Jayson, and was able to select the files, compress, and change the extension from <code>.zip</code> to <code>.deltaSkin</code>. Pretty easy. I didn’t have any issues with the Files app other than some slow exports from Figurative.</p>
<h2 id="committing-code-to-github">Committing Code to GitHub</h2>
<p>I chose to host my files as an <a href="https://github.com/AndrewHaglund/delta-absorb">open source project on GitHub</a>. The big asterisk here is that my Figma files are not <em>yet</em> public. While I’ll host these themes on Gumroad and <a href="https://deltastyles.com">DeltaStyles</a> for discoverability I thought it was in the spirt of Delta emulator itself being <a href="https://github.com/rileytestut/Delta">open source</a> that my files are “out there” for anyone.</p>
<p>Doing all the file management of creating the skins (zipping, renaming, editing JSON, exporting PDFs) meant that I wanted a good git client. Turns out there is <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com">Working Copy</a> by <a href="https://indieapps.space/@palmin@mastodon.social">Anders Borum</a>! I happily paid $25. It stings a <em>little</em> knowing VS Code is free on macOS and it handles everything I need, but this Working Copy is a powerhouse. (I’ll be able to use this app for posting to my blog so it’s not just a one-time cost.)</p>
<p>After committing changes on my iPad I was able to iteratively test and debug my new GBA skin on my iPhone by sending it over AirDrop, make changes on iPad, send over, commit my work, and so on until I got everything working just right.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>While I had to fallback to the Mac for the design part — partly due to wanting a bigger screen and iPadOS font limitations — I was able to do most of this work from my iPad.</p>
<p>This is an exciting prospect as I tend to keep my MacBook Pro docked at my desk as a “desktop laptop.” This makes my iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard a perfect “around the house” machine. If I’m doing some online shopping I can leave the keyboard and just use this lovely big screen. If I want to get some serious work done or write a blog post from the back porch, I snap on the keyboard. If I want to plan some electrical upgrades and need to doodle a bit — I grab the Apple Pencil.</p>
<p>It’s kind of an amazing device and it echoes the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/modular-computer/">modular computing idea</a> Federico is always going on about. (Next up is getting it to work with my Gamesir G8 controller. Currently I’m using this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZBRG92Z?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details">90-degree female-to-male USB-C cable</a>.)</p>
<p>I think my future experimentations might lie in building an app or something to automate the tedious JSON creation for Delta skins. Designing these is a lot of fun. Editing JSON is not.</p>
<p>In summary here are my main complaints with iPadOS for this workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figma is not good on iPadOS. I’m not sure if this is a Safari problem or Figma but it’s kind of a huge let down that it doesn’t work well — even with a mouse and keyboard.</li>
<li>Apple’s own SF fonts are impossible to install from an iPad.</li>
<li>It would be remarkable if VS Code came to iPad. It’s an amazing IDE. I’m glad Working Copy exists but this would be a big game changer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly: If you’re playing retro games on your iPhone as much as I am, take a look at my custom skin, <a href="https://github.com/AndrewHaglund/delta-absorb">Absorb</a>, for Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance. They’re great for nighttime playing! Just download the <code>.deltaSkin</code> files and go into Delta’s settings to install.</p>

		<a href="https://haglund.app/2024/05/12/mapkeep.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-05-12 19:00:00 -0500">May 12, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yesterday I launched version 1.2 of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833">MapKeep</a> — an iPhone and Apple Watch app that lets you capture your current location in one tap — with a few useful features.</p>
<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>
<p>Since adding the “long press to add” feature in version 1.1 I’ve wanted a <strong>satellite view</strong> of the map to give a better sense of where to place the pin. In 1.2 you can now switch to satellite view using the map style button.</p>
<p>After using the app for 6 months, my map was super cluttered with all the pins I’ve saved. (Especially on Apple Watch!) This update adds <strong>date filters</strong>. Just look for the calendar button on the map.</p>
<p>Neither feature are fully baked — the date options aren’t ideal and your options don’t persist between sessions — but I had a specific timeline<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> in mind to get this update out the door.</p>
<h2 id="other-enhancements">Other Enhancements</h2>
<p>I wanted to improve how the app works when the user hasn’t granted location access. Previously the map was completely blocked if location access was denied. This didn’t sit right with me for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>With 1.1’s “long press to add” you don’t <em>technically</em> need location permission to use the app.</li>
<li>If you created pins <em>then</em> denied location access, it was impossible to view (or export) your collection.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the app feels more seamless than before; the splashy request location view gets replaced with the “add” button after location is permitted. Simple. Even though the app is completely private, I wanted to go above and beyond here.</p>
<h2 id="bugs">Bugs</h2>
<p>Lastly it seems like a <a href="https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/748996">SwiftUI bug</a> was introduced in iOS 17.3 or 17.4 having to do with using <code>@Environment</code> with <code>modelContainer</code>. If you created a pin on Apple Watch it would wake up the iPhone app in the background to sync with iCloud then crash silently in the background. I have a workaround to fix this but it’s not ideal.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h2>
<p>The theme here is that I’m glad I shipped this update but I feel like there’s a lot of room for improvement. I hope to chip away at this before WWDC hits early June. Time will tell.</p>

<p>Two things urged me to get back into the swing of things:</p>

<p>One <em>could</em> call this motivation. Another less healthy term would be anxiety or obsession. I get this reeling feeling of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have to do this, I have to do this, I have to do this…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I put a lot of false urgency on myself — it’s something I need to work on. I love the challenge of making an iOS app but <strong>everything in moderation</strong>. I need to have balance and headspace for other more important things in my life.</p>

This entire ecosystem was just <em>dying</em> to get emulation added to the mix. Federico and John covered this well on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/macstories-unwind/id1510451759?i=1000653687197">MacStories Unwind</a>.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The past few years I’ve been following along with Russ at <a href="https://retrogamecorps.com/author/onionsaregross/">Retro Game Corp</a> and have bought the <a href="https://retrogamecorps.com/2022/05/15/miyoo-mini-v2-guide/">Miyoo Mini</a>, a <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg353v-rg353vs">couple</a> <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xx-h">Anbernics</a>, and even the <a href="https://www.analogue.co/pocket">Analogue Pocket</a>. I see now that I have a problem but I find comfort in knowing <a href="https://wavelengths.online/posts/on-cheap-handhelds-in-a-world-of-smartphone-emulation">Brendon Bigley</a> (of <a href="https://intothecast.online/"><em>Into the Aether</em></a>) is in the same boat.</p>
<p>While these devices can be great uni-taskers with good physical controls, they all fall short of the iPhone when it comes to screen quality, staying charged, and <strong>convenience</strong>:</p>
<p>While waiting in line for coffee on Sunday I pulled out my iPhone and played a few Pokemon battles (thanks to turbo mode) and caught a Jigglypuff. There’s <em>no way</em> I would have even thought to bring one of those other devices on this quick neighborhood outing. Combine that with auto-saving when putting the phone to sleep — it’s just so easy to dip in and out.</p>

<p>I bought a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Orzero-Controller-Compatible-Adjustable-Accessories/dp/B0CJCB2P11">magnetic monstrosity</a> for the PS5 controller. This thing is <em>heavy</em> and pairing to Bluetooth (then remembering to power it off) is not fun. Pro: the magnet lets you rotate the phone to portrait mode for an <em>amazing</em> DS experience (if you can get it balanced). I also tried the <a href="https://playbackbone.com/products/backbone-one-usb-c-playstation/">Backbone</a> and thought it felt flimsy with too-small buttons and joysticks.

<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Cowboy Carter</em> by Beyoncé is phenomenal. I’ll be flabbergasted if it doesn’t win Album of the Year.</li>
<li><em>Tigers Blood</em> by Waxahatchee is an instant classic.</li>
<li><em>Ultimatum (Expanded Edition)</em> by The Long Winters reminds me why I love music.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anticipating new music from The Decemberists, Vampire Weekend, and Iron &amp; Wine later this year.</p>
<h2 id="tv">TV</h2>
<p><strong>March</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fargo</em> (season 1 and 2) is in the pantheon of “greatest shows of all-time” for sure.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>February</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Scavengers Reign</em> is beautiful (and also grotesque). Incredible.</li>
<li><em>Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith</em> was a fun ride. First episode felt a bit slow, maybe? Donald Glover and Maya Erskine were awesome together.</li>
<li><em>The Afterparty</em> (season 1) was a fun whodunnit with a great cast. Gotta love <del>Richard Splett</del> Sam Richardson.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>January</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>All Creatures Great &amp; Small</em> (season 4) never disappoints and is a routine post-holiday “feel good” show for the wife and I.</li>
<li><em>Queer Eye</em> is always fun to watch, it’s one of the only reality shows I will stick around for. (I know it’s a common joke but <em>please</em> give Bobby more airtime.)</li>
<li><em>BEEF</em> (season 1) holy shit we loved this.</li>
<li><em>For All Mankind</em> (season 4) does not disappoint. Can’t wait for next season.</li>
<li><em>Yellowjackets</em> (season 2) was fine. Season 1 was engrossing but it feels like there’s not a ton of mystery left?</li>
<li><em>The Curse</em> was outstanding. I know it’s divisive but I think it’s absolutely brilliant. If you want more <em>Nathan for You</em>, this is not for you.</li>
<li><em>Star Wars: Visions</em> (season 2) continues to inspire me with its diverse art styles from around the world. It is <em>phenomenal</em>. It single-handedly gives me hope that Disney will someday make a good Star Wars movie — they just need to let creators do what they want (instead of trying to redo the Marvel playbook).</li>
<li><em>Slow Horses</em> (season 3) is a gem and a must-see. I am usually anti-binge but I watched this in a single sitting.</li>
<li><em>Fisk</em> is a fun lil Australian Office-like.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p>We watched most Best Picture nominations this year and were deliberately trying to watch more film. TV can be a bit of a drag sometimes. Each episode tends to feel like an <em>appetizer</em> where a movie is a <em>meal</em>.</p>
<p><strong>March</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Midsommar</em> I should not have watched this. I was home alone for the weekend and it freaked me out. This is a disturbing (yet somehow beautiful) movie that left me thinking for days.</li>
<li><em>Napoleon</em> had exciting war scenes, sets, costumes, etc. I’m glad I watched it. Not a “must see” but it was entertaining.</li>
<li><em>Dune: Part Two</em> was a masterclass of cinema. We saw this in IMAX and were blown away.</li>
<li><em>Poor Things</em> was odd, delightful, and excellently done. I loved the style and world they created for this film and glad Emma won another Oscar.</li>
<li><em>Wonka</em> (2024) was bad. I expected to learn how Wonka went from a fun-loving chocolate maker to a maniacal recluse. Instead Timothée Chalamet <em>tries</em> being silly as an indentured servant. If 80% of your runtime is about laundry, you know you’ve screwed up. A few nice moments but overall a huge miss. (Also a main character’s name is Noodle. Noodle!)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>February</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</em> was fine. Good ending to the series I guess. <em>Thor Ragnorok</em> and <em>Guardians 1</em> were lightning-in-a-bottle and their sequels have all been a letdown.</li>
<li><em>Jenny Slate: Seasoned Professional</em> was incredibly funny. This was the first time we had watched her standup. I only knew her from <em>Parks &amp; Rec</em>.</li>
<li><em>Paterson</em> (2016): very random but I was in a hotel room so I had nothing else going on. Dan Benjamin mentioned it in <a href="https://www.backtowork.limo/638"><em>Back to Work 638</em></a> so I gave it a shot. Slow and sleepy but a nice slice of life.</li>
<li><em>Oppenheimer</em> (rewatch). I watched this with my parents (it was their first viewing) and as soon as credits rolled both of them went “woah” and that’s when I knew it’d win Best Picture.</li>
<li><em>American Fiction</em> was excellent. Jeffrey Wright and the whole cast were outstanding.</li>
<li><em>Princess Mononoke</em>: I’m slowly watching all the Ghibli/Miyazaki movies. This one’s surprisingly violent! Beautiful animation.</li>
<li><em>Asteroid City</em>: I am a longtime fan of Wes Anderson but this movie just made me angry. Everything about this production is world-class: cast, costume, and designs; but the story had no heart. I felt <em>nothing</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>January</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Anatomy of a Fall</em> was a great mystery. It played with the timeline of events really well. The courtroom scenes, while probably not realistic, were exceptional.</li>
<li><em>May December</em> had terrific performances by Portman and Moore. The ending felt a bit anticlimactic. The ending made us think, “wait, that’s it?”</li>
<li><em>Maestro</em> is world-class. Bradley did good. The scene where he’s conducting in the cathedral was incredible. Classical music FTW.</li>
<li><em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em> was outstanding. I read the book a few years ago and thought Marty did a great job adapting it into a riveting story. Like <em>Oppenheimer</em> you’d have no idea this was 3 hours long, it flew by.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Shift</em> (book 2 of <em>Silo</em> series)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="theater">Theater</h2>
<ul>
<li>We saw <em>Hamilton</em> in Chicago. I listened to the soundtrack a bunch in 2020 and saw the Disney Plus version. My parents and brother went in cold turkey and we all had a blast. Angelica (Lencia Kebede) and King George III (Paul Louis Lessard) were fantastic. It’s tough comparing to the original cast but those two were standouts.</li>
<li><em>The Witch</em> (Krannert Center for the Performing Arts) was a modern and fun retelling of <em>The Witch</em> from the 1600s.</li>

			 <p>My <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@haglund/112135073528546378">initial reaction</a> to hearing about the United States versus Apple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’d boil down the DoJ lawsuit as “Apple works hard to ensure their product has good and people like it” and apparently that is illegal? I totally agree with the App Store complaint. These other things are… yeesh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later I read <a href="http://manton.micro.blog/2024/03/21/early-thoughts-on.html">Manton Reece’s thoughts</a>, which more or less aligns with mine. The App Store is an absolute cluster of corrosive incentives for Apple which <del>limits</del> hurts businesses<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and stifles innovation.</p>
<p>Jason Snell has a <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/03/u-s-versus-apple-a-first-reaction/">great piece at Six Colors</a>. In a nutshell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lock-in will be on trial.</strong> Many of the DoJ arguments come down to this: Every feature that Apple builds that makes it harder to switch to an Android phone is fundamentally anticompetitive. … the DoJ envisions a competitive smartphone market … in which there’s as little friction as possible when jumping between platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As he mentions, the CarPlay and Apple TV+ arguments are asinine. This part, however, got me worried about what precedent this case could set:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it illegal for Apple to use its power to improve the user experience? What about when it cuts itself in for some sweet Services revenue along the way?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I design for a <a href="/2024/03/04/working-at-john.html">big corporation</a> so I’m part of the <em>Big Scary Tech</em> this bill is targeting (therefore my perspective is biased). As I read more on the topic, my mind keeps wandering back to this doomsday of question: is Design — the art of making things with value, with quality, with utility — ultimately under attack?</p>
<hr>
<p>While I disagree with some ideas in this lawsuit, I’m fascinated to see what happens.</p>
<p>Apple could stand to loosen up a bit, without losing much. Let apps run outside the App Store. Let people use the smartwatch of their choice. Let users use their godawful bank as an alternative wallet to Apple Pay. What we’ll all learn together is that the total package, the <em>design</em> of this ecosystem, is what customers pay for and <em>want</em>.</p>
<p>In other words: if Apple has to compete, I’m confident they’ll win.</p>

			 <p>My UX career started with an internship at <a href="https://www.cazoodle.com">Cazoodle</a> (a now-defunct, as far as I can tell) startup in the University of Illinois Research Park. After a year or so I got the opportunity to intern at the John Deere Innovation Center in Champaign, where I worked on mobile apps and had a blast. I owe a lot to my then (and now) <a href="https://inkypixelsdesign.com/">boss</a> for how my career has unfolded so far.</p>
<p>In 2017 I left John Deere to join a <a href="https://nutrienagsolutions.com/agrible">startup</a> and followed that path for 5 years (a story for another time). I’ve been back at John Deere for about a year-and-a-half and it’s amazing how a company with such a long history has adapted and modernized in a few short years.</p>
<p>Yesterday a colleague shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I3z-3zAd_Y">corporate video</a> about what it’s like working at John Deere. I think it rings true and echoes the reasons I returned to the company and love my job. Hopefully I don’t come off as a corporate shill, but I do sincerely think it’s a great place to build a career and make an impact.</p>
<p>I’m incredibly lucky.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/21/24045324/apple-magic-mouse-wireless-charging-lightning-base">Wes Davis at The Verge</a> wrote about accessories that attempt to make the Magic Mouse more ergonomic. I bought <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C7G8V4PC?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">one of these</a> on a whim back in November with the expectation it could address a few issues with Apple’s Magic Mouse:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increase the bulk of the mouse to help my hand rest more comfortably.</li>
<li>Easier charging thanks to wireless charging.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="comfort">Comfort</h2>
<p>On the whole I would say these accessories do make Magic Mouse more comfortable when mousing around or when resting your hand while reading. You’ll need to remind yourself to let your hand relax more but all-around you do get a more “hand-friendly” object.</p>
<p>Scrolling is where things fall apart. It may shock you to learn that we scroll <em>a lot</em> when using computers. When using two-finger scrolling with Magic Mouse your fingers are pitched and need to move more than a standard scroll-wheel. The shoe doesn’t make this interaction <em>less</em> comfortable, but it does not improve it. Despite its derisive design, I’m not sure how Apple could have made two-finger scrolling more comfortable.</p>
<h2 id="wireless-charging">Wireless Charging</h2>
<p>Adding wireless charging to Magic Mouse is nicer than spearing the turtle with a lightning cable. I could quickly attach the mouse to a MagSafe puck when getting up for lunch meaning the battery would always be topped up.</p>
<p>One downside is that is causes a <em>tiny</em> electrical hum when charging. It took me a while to notice it at first but then it was impossible to <em>not</em> notice (see also: the arrow in the FedEx logo).</p>
<p>Another quirk is that you can’t use Magic Mouse while it’s charging. The mouse shuts off w because it assumes it’s upside-down with a cable jutting out. I imagined using a <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/mice-mouse-pads/mouse-pads/rog-balteus-qi-model/">Qi mouse pad</a> for endless battery life but this is not possible.</p>
<p>The last kicker is that I switch between a work and personal MacBook daily which requires removing the boot and pairing directly by Lightning each time I switch computers. I’d guess most people don’t have this problem, but I thought I’d mention it.</p>
<h2 id="verdict">Verdict</h2>
<p>These boots helped me realized the Magic Mouse itself no longer for me. Between poor multi-device support and discomfort, I decided to dig out an <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/m510-wireless-mouse.910-001822.html?crid=7">old Logitech mouse</a> which solves both problems: good ergonomics by default and automatically pairing (its USB-A dongle stays plugged into my Thunderbolt dock).</p>

			 <p>I haven’t been able to try Apple Vision Pro yet, but the Mac screen-sharing feature reminded me of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10245?time=444">“Design for Spatial Interactions”</a> session from WWDC 2021. It’s fascinating that Apple has been using this “spatial” term for a few years now.</p>
<p>Like all Apple Design videos, it’s excellent. They talk about the precision locating UI for AirTag and the interactions behind handoff for HomePod mini. Putting your iPhone <em>near</em> your HomePod will move audio from iPhone to HomePod. It’s pretty magical. In both cases they’re talking about how physical — or spatial — actions can convey user intent, something traditionally conveyed with taps or buttons.</p>
<p>This is relevant for Vision Pro’s Mac screen-sharing feature. It’s triggered by looking at your Mac. There are some other clever features like the autocomplete bar that floats above your physical Bluetooth keyboard but this <em>just look at it</em> gesture seems under-utilized in visionOS 1.0 and could be extended much further.</p>
<p>For example: you’re watching a movie in Vision Pro and your spouse arrives home. What if you could look at your AirPlay-enabled TV and it could start playback on <em>that</em> screen, letting you share that experience in reality.</p>
<p>Or similarly, say you’re listening to music on Vision Pro. Look at a HomePod to handoff the audio. (There are <em>dozens</em> of HomePod owners who could benefit from something like this.) Similarly what if the audio seamlessly followed you as you moved from room to room — without blasting on every speaker in the house.</p>
<p>Maybe looking at a HomePod could cause a flurry of your favorite albums to flutter above. With a look you could start playing music. Eliminating the need to recall and verbalize a lengthy album title and artist, bringing that familiar feeling of the family record player.</p>
<p>Or would it be possible to use your iPhone’s keyboard for Vision Pro just by looking at your phone? (This could work similar to the Apple TV input handoff.) The typing experience on visionOS without a physical keyboard is  severely lacking so this could be a game-changer.</p>
<p>(As an extension of this, what if you could AirPlay your iPhone into Vision Pro? This could be a sweet solution for getting offline videos for travel situations if native apps from big players like YouTube and Netflix never show up.)</p>
<p>Or what if someone wants to show you a photo on <em>their</em> phone while you’re wearing the headset like a sociopath? Maybe they could cast it into <em>your</em> headset to enjoy a beautiful panorama from a recent trip.</p>
<hr>
<p>These are just a few examples that come to mind. I think there is a huge opportunity to rethink how we interact with <em>digital</em> things in a <em>physical</em> way. By all accounts Apple Vision Pro and visionOS are very 1.0 and I’m excited to see where this takes us over the next decade.</p>

			 <p>The other weekend my wife and I watched the excellent <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em> on Apple TV+. We opted to skip the theatrical and digital purchase windows despite loving <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/193388249-killers-of-the-flower-moon">the book</a> and Apple’s caginess around when <em>exactly</em> the film would debut on the streaming service.</p>
<p>Right off the bat the movie’s <a href="https://soundtracks.lnk.to/killersofflower">soundtrack</a> by the <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/listen-to-robbie-robertson-soundtrack-for-new-martin-scorsese-movie-killers-of-the-flower-moon/">late Robbie Robertson</a> set the tone<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and pace. We were hooked. A few minutes in, however, we started noticing blocky pixels — the video stream oscillating between vivid 4K and 240p pixelated mush from minute to minute.</p>
<p>It was just how Marty intended.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>I naively thought pausing would give it a chance to buffer and it’d be smooth sailing. As the stuttering continued I restarted the Apple TV, force quit the TV app, ran a speed test<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and yet the issue persisted. Then the stream <em>completely</em> failed and a panic set upon the room. Life happens pretty fast. You never know the next time you’ll have the time and disposition to watch a three hour movie. <strong>It was now or never.</strong></p>
<p>I wondered if the problem was with <em>streaming</em> the movie so I opened the TV app on my iPhone, found the movie, and hit download. A minute later the download completed and I used AirPlay to put it on the TV. The rest of the movie went without a hitch<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and we enjoyed the riveting and heartbreaking story of the Osage killings.</p>
<hr>
<p>It was less than ideal needing two Apple devices to watch an Apple-produced movie. This is because Apple TV+ in the TV app on the Apple TV hardware does not support <strong>downloading</strong> video. For inexplicable reasons this overpriced hockey puck comes in <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-tv/apple-tv-4k">2 storage tiers</a> but you can’t actually <em>store</em> anything on it.</p>
<p>That said I can see why Apple might not want to implement this feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike an iPhone you’re unlikely to take an Apple TV with you on an airplane and need to load up on movies before takeoff.</li>
<li>Then there’s the messiness of managing and removing downloaded media.</li>
<li>I fear Apple is allergic of buttons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you have a slower than average network at home, intermittent server outages, or taking an Apple TV to a hotel or Airbnb TV with crappy Wi-Fi, there are scenarios that could make this feature worthwhile.</p>
<p>The most straightforward solution is offering a download button on the episode or movie detail view — just like on iOS and the Mac. (Maybe a long press on the Play button could expose a menu with this option.)</p>
<p>Another idea is treating download as a <em>fallback</em> to streaming. Maybe the OS could notice streaming quality is low and prompt the user with something like, “Download movie? This can take a few moments but should play without interruption afterwards.” Playback could resume from the same spot using the local file and get automatically offloaded 24 hours later.</p>
<p>I know offline downloading is not a glamorous feature but little touches like this could make the Apple TV a bit more forgiving in the real world.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I saw <a href="https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2024/01/the-mac-turns-40/">several</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24048479/apple-mac-40-anniversary">lovely</a> posts celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Mac today. The 30th gave us the wonderful <a href="https://rknightuk.github.io/mac-30-font-svg/">Mac Font</a> and somehow feels like yesterday. A lot has changed in the world and my life since then, but one thing has been a constant:</p>
<p>I’ve always felt at home with the Mac.</p>
<p>I have a scattering of memories with the Mac throughout my life. I recall playing with vintage Macs in the school library in kindergarten or first-grade (circa 1996). I was blown away by the <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/218460/the-exceptional-imac-g4-ten-years-later.html">iMac G4</a> and it’s the reason I went into design. It showed how products can <em>delight</em>. I spent countless hours after school using my grandma’s iMac G5 to <del>do homework</del> play games.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t until I had my own Mac that I fell in love. After a couple summers working for the high school alumni newsletter (produced with G3, G4, and G5 Power Macs) I saved up and bought a 12” iBook G4. Bonus: it came with a silver iPod mini. I curated a music collection and customized every aspect of it with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031206095326/http://www.panic.com/candybar/">Candybar</a>. After running through multiple (and expensive) power cables and batteries, I made a massive jump to a white Intel MacBook.</p>
<p>I used the hell out of that Mac. I learned Illustrator, Final Cut Pro, Garageband, Photoshop, and so many other tools that let me explore being creative. It was my portal to the internet and chatting with friends on <a href="https://www.adium.im">Adium</a>. It’s where I amassed an astounding amount of <del>legally obtained</del> music and movies that shaped my taste.</p>
<p>The Mac fits my brain in a way where I can create and work effortlessly. It’s always had a flourishing community of developers building utilities to extend platform. The flexibility and openness of the Mac is what makes it so special.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> From PowerPC to Intel then Intel to Apple Silicon I’ve seen huge leaps in what Mac are capable of. <em>The Mac Goes On</em> and I’ve enjoyed witnessing the evolution from Tiger to Sonoma.</p>
<p>Here’s to 40 more.</p>

<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>I want this post to celebrate what I love about the Mac. These points on openness and flexibility highlight my, and governments around the world, frustrations with iOS, iPadOS, and (soon to be) visionOS. These systems are closed off and I think it does a lot more harm than good.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Today I learned about Chesterton’s Fence thanks to <a href="https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom/blob/master/wisdom.md">Merlin Mann’s <em>Wisdom Project</em></a>:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learn about Chesterton’s Fence. Then, actively resist altering a given situation before you understand the reasons why it’s remained unchanged for so long.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This piqued my interest and I read<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> a <a href="https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/">post by Shane Parrish</a> which summarizes G. K. Chesterton’s 1929 idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not remove a fence unless you know why it was put up in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One example is from <a href="https://steveblank.com/2009/12/21/the-elves-leave-middle-earth-%E2%80%93-soda%E2%80%99s-are-no-longer-free/">Steve Blank’s <em>The Elves Leave Middle Earth – Sodas Are No Longer Free</em></a> about a startup CFO killing free snacks without understanding the knock-on effects. It’s a great anecdote.</p>
<p>Parrish’s post concludes (original emphasis):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It reminds us that we don’t always know better than those who made decisions before us, and we can’t see all the nuances to a situation until we’re intimate with it. <strong>Unless we know why someone made a decision, we can’t safely change it or conclude that they were wrong.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The first step before modifying an aspect of a system is to understand it. Observe it in full. Note how it interconnects with other aspects, including ones that might not be linked to you personally. Learn how it works, and then propose your change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m sure you can apply this lesson to your life one way or another (otherwise it wouldn’t be in the <em>Wisdom Project</em>) but it resonated with me as a designer and someone who works in software.</p>
<p>You might have seen a portfolio piece from a UX designer who proclaimed, “I fixed Twitter!”<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> with a beautiful reimagining of the interface. These projects can be a great way for designers to learn and explore their own taste but please be humble. You don’t have a full picture of the priorities and constraints the design team was under nor the problem they were asked to solve.</p>
<p>While the expression “Chesteron’s Fence” was new to me, the idea was not. I received it as advice and it changed my approach when I started my job at Agrible back in 2017. I was the first design lead at the startup and they had been making software for a few years. My instinct was to move fast and make changes but instead I spent my first few weeks listening to the team and learning the product before suggesting any process or design changes.</p>
<p>It’s a skill I try to practice when any new project comes my way. Stay open-minded and don’t think about your decisions in a vacuum.</p>

		<a href="https://haglund.app/2024/01/12/visiting-john-deere.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-01-12 19:00:00 -0500">Jan 12, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This past week I was lucky enough to visit the renowned John Deere Headquarters in Moline, IL. The buildings were designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eero_Saarinen">Eero Saarinen</a> (known for his work on the St. Louis Arch) and landscaped by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideo_Sasaki">Hideo Sasaki</a>. My timing could not have been better with the weather and I was able to experience the area in all its winter glory.</p>
<p>As you approach you see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Deere_%26_Company_World_Headquarters.jpg">massive structure</a> perched on a hill with a road that winds around a pond. It’s an impressive sight that makes you think: damn, this must be a big company. (This trip in particular evoked the snowy cliffside temple from Nolan’s <em>Batman Begins</em>.)</p>
<h1 id="nighttime">Nighttime</h1>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There are several incredibly long hallways to get from the parking lot to the office spaces. Walking throughout the structure gave me <em>Severance</em> vibes, which coincidentally was filmed at another Saarinen creation: <a href="https://bell.works/new-jersey/explore">Bell Works</a>.</p>
<h1 id="garden">Garden</h1>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Aside from its zen garden, pond, modular grid system, and mid-century design, the standout feature, to me, is the atrium filled with plants and basked in sunlight.</p>
<p>Leaving headquarters involves driving slowly through a hilly wooded area. There are moments where you can see the building but by-and-large you’re enveloped by trees. I couldn’t help but notice the physical transition going from work to life. You’re forced to drive through nature and leave behind the corporate edifice. As someone who works fully-remote, there was something nice about that.</p>
<p>I’m positive the designers intended all these beautiful and inspiring moments. It delivers.</p>

			 <h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
<p>My goal is to collect the stories and art I experienced in 2023 with a sprinkle of personal updates. Reflecting on the year was a fun process and I hope to turn this into an annual tradition.</p>
<h2 id="tech-stories">Tech Stories</h2>
<p>There were a lot of disastrous tech stories this year but <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/23andme-credential-stuffing-data-stolen/">23andMe’s data breach</a> has a special spot in my heart. When I think about the implications for how this data could be misused (off the dome: planting false evidence at a crime scene, the inevitability of nonconsensual cloning), I have a hard time racking my brain for data that’s more sensitive. Stories like this <em>should</em> remind us to be more thoughtful of what we put online. Based on what I see on LinkedIn (a “professional” network), society has ways to go.</p>
<p>Other stories that spring to mind are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/gm-justifies-decision-to-ditch-apple-carplay-due-to-stability-issues/">GM’s bone-headed decision to drop CarPlay</a> and the spectacular bungled effort to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23981848/sam-altman-back-open-ai-ceo-microsoft-board">fire Sam Altman</a>. The world came <em>this close</em> to Microsoft hiring every employee from OpenAI.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Speaking of close calls: <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-adobe-abandon-proposed-merger/">Adobe almost acquired Figma</a>. I’m bummed for the Figma employees (who missed out on a big windfall) but this is probably for the best.</p>
<p>We saw the <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/12/31/elon-musks-x-fidelity-valuation-cut">collapse of Twitter</a>, which was bound to happen, but did anyone think it’d deteriorate this quickly? In its wake we saw the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/10/23787453/meta-instagram-threads-100-million-users-milestone">meteoric launch of Threads</a> and <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon’s</a> slow-and-steady growth. I hope smaller services like <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> are getting their day in the sun. In 2024 and beyond I’m ready for a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-commentary/internet-future-about-to-get-weird-1234938403/">weirder internet</a>.</p>
<p>It’s for these reasons I’m starting a blog.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> After years of posting to <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewhaglund">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/andrewhaglund/">Instagram</a>, it’s time to have a proper home on the web. I’ve settled on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short, frequent posts on <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@haglund">Mastodon</a></li>
<li>Long, infrequent posts here (<a href="/feed.xml">subscribe via RSS</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-year-of-development">The Year of Development</h2>
<p>I prefer <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex/150">Yearly Themes</a> over resolutions and while I didn’t plan a theme for 2023, reflecting on the past year helped a theme emerge retroactively: <em>the Year of Development</em>.</p>
<p>After the initial excitement of the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/wwdc23-highlights/">Vision Pro unveiling at WWDC</a> I spent many summer nights and weekends learning SwiftUI and SwiftData. In September I launched my first app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833">MapKeep</a>.</p>
<p>I noodled around with an app for Merlin Mann’s <a href="https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom/blob/master/wisdom.md">Wisdom Project</a> and a packing/shopping list app based on Myke Hurley’s request in <a href="https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/489">Upgrade 489</a>). These projects are on-hold for now.</p>
<p>Weebly hosted my personal site for 10 years but I grew tired of its outdated editor and <em>godawful</em> blogging tools. I used this as an excuse to learn HTML/CSS and rebuilt my site from scratch. At the end of December the site was rebuilt again using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">Eleventy</a>.</p>
<h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>
<p>I visited Des Moines, IA, for a week every quarter for “in-person week” at work. My brother happened to live there which meant we could get dinner downtown or watch an episode of <em>The Sopranos</em> at his apartment. Those days are behind us now that he’s moved to Chicago. It reminds me to always take advantage of opportunities to see family.</p>
<p>I went to Florida to visit sugar cane growers in February. The area was recovering from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/us/hurricane-ian-fort-myers-beach-florida/index.html">Hurricane Ian</a> and the destruction was awful. Fort Myers Beach was on a boil order. The hotel was underwater days before I checked-in. I spent a few hours walking the beach and marveled at collapsed hotels, restaurants, and homes.</p>
<p>In May we went to Michigan for a high-school friend’s wedding. A week later we went to a cousin’s high school graduation in Denver and we hiked at <a href="https://www.jeffco.us/1332/Mount-Falcon-Park">Mount Falcon Park</a>.</p>
<p>As an annual tradition we spent a week with my in-laws in Madison, WI, in June visiting downtown, breweries, and the <a href="https://union.wisc.edu/visit/terrace-at-the-memorial-union/">UW Union Terrace</a>. In August we made a trip to Missouri for our niece’s 2nd birthday.</p>
<p>At the end of September a close friend and college roommate got married in the Virginia/DC area. We had great time reminiscing over our stupidity in college.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>I continue to work for John Deere as a UX Lead and love it. I was recently promoted and my area of responsibly has grown and I now directly manage a few designers. I’m adjusting to the new role and I’ll be reading <em><a href="https://hbr.org/books/watkins">The First 90 Days</a></em> ASAP.</p>
<p>I’m fortunate to have a <a href="https://inkypixelsdesign.com">great mentor and manager</a>. This was a tough year for layoffs across a lot of industries and I don’t take my position for granted.</p>
<p>I try to stay connected with the University of Illinois and in March I gave a talk about the design process at the <a href="https://designcenter.illinois.edu/">Siebel Center of Design</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="games">Games</h2>
<p>I’m approaching the end of the main storyline in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> and … what a masterpiece. <em>Mario Wonder</em> was a blast! 2023 was <a href="https://intothecast.transistor.fm/episodes/the-2023-game-of-the-year-spectacular">filled with amazing games</a> and I expect my <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/oled">OLED Steam Deck</a> can help expose me to more non-Nintendo games in 2024.</p>
<p>I’ve been playing retro games:</p>

<li><em>Pokémon Red</em> (<a href="https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/2362/">Anniversary romhack</a>) and <em>Tetris</em> on my silver <a href="https://www.analogue.co/pocket">Analogue Pocket</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.shipofharkinian.com">PC port</a> of <em>Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> on the Mac.</li>
<li><em>Super Mario World</em>, naturally.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Christmas the <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/covert-dock-2">Genki dock</a> let my cousins and I (ranging from ages 12 to 32) play local co-op with 6-players in <em>Super Smash Bros</em>. Chaotic joy.</p>
<h2 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h2>
<p>I heard the podcast ad market was tough in 2023. Hosts would mention this occasionally and I noticed fewer (or zero) ads. I decided to open <a href="https://bellroy.com/products/card-sleeve-wallet?color=hazelnut&amp;material=leather&amp;size=default">my wallet</a> and financially support the work I love:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://atp.fm/">Accidental Tech Podcast</a></em>: Exceptionally consistent. Gotta support John now that <a href="https://hypercritical.co/2022/03/30/independence-day">he’s gone indie</a>.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://intothecast.online">Into the Aether</a></em>: I have a tremendous appreciation for the art of video game creation thanks to Brendon and Stephen.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/Roderick/">Roderick on the Line</a></em>: I’ve been listening to the internet’s Merlin Mann and the Long Winters’ John Roderick for a <em>long time</em>.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.relay.fm/upgrade">Upgrade</a></em>: Myke and Jason’s segments on Apple and the entertainment industry keep me coming back week after week.</li>
</ul>
<p>I loved <a href="https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/mccartney-a-life-in-lyrics">Sir McCartney’s show</a> where he tells the stories behind his killer songs.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2024 I want to reduce my podcast intake or introduce more variety. It’s too easy for me to pop-in an AirPod and tune-out the world. I’m not giving myself enough time for silence.</p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>Thanks to Apple Music’s awkward <a href="https://replay.music.apple.com/">Replay</a> feature I have a list of most-listened music from 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://boygenius.lnk.to/therecord">the record</a></em> by boygenius</li>
<li><em><a href="https://oliviarodrigo.lnk.to/GUTS">GUTS</a></em> by Olivia Rodrigo</li>
<li><em><a href="https://m83.lnk.to/fantasy">Fantasy</a></em> by M83</li>
<li><em><a href="https://af.lnk.to/_WEAW">WE</a></em> by Arcade Fire (2022)</li>
<li><em><a href="https://interscope.lnk.to/Multitudes">Multitudes</a></em> by Feist</li>
<li><em><a href="https://death-cab-for-cutie.lnk.to/AMAcoustic">Asphalt Meadows (Acoustic)</a></em> by Death Cab for Cutie</li>
<li><em><a href="https://mitski.lnk.to/TLIIASAW">The Land Is Hospitable and So Are We</a></em> by Mitski</li>
<li><em><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/oppenheimer-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1697599270">Oppenheimer</a></em> by Ludwig Göransson</li>
<li><em><a href="https://daftpunk.lnk.to/RAM_Originals">Random Access Memories</a></em> by Daft Punk (2013) is routinely played on Friday afternoons as work winds down. (I will <strong>not</strong> link to the drumless abomination.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other music highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>I started digging into Peter Gabriel’s <em><a href="https://lnk.to/PG21">i/o</a></em>. There are 3 mixes of the album which is fascinating. I can’t explain it but the acoustic guitar in the opening track <em>Panopticom</em> fills me with joy.</li>
<li>Sufjan Stevens’ <em><a href="https://sufjanstevens.lnk.to/javelin">Javelin</a></em> was lovely but I haven’t listened to it enough.</li>
<li>I recorded a short composition called <a href="https://soundcloud.com/andrewhaglund/a-quiet-night"><em>A Quiet Night</em></a>.</li>
<li>As part of a Christmas gift I introduced my brother to some chords on the guitar.</li>
<li>My hopes are high for Michael Stipe’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/03/magazine/michael-stipe-solo-album.html">first post-R.E.M. album</a> (I first heard it teased on <a href="https://www.smartless.com/episodes/episode/24585bee/michael-stipe">Smartless</a>). The <a href="https://found.ee/rem-up25"><em>Up</em> remaster</a> was impeccable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Live shows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rodgab.com">Rodrigo y Gabriela</a> at Krannert’s <a href="https://krannertcenter.com/ellnora">Ellnora</a> festival. They’re gods. (Thanks to Señora Kooy, my high school Spanish teacher, who originally introduced me to this duo.)</li>
<li><a href="https://laurenmayberry.co.uk">Lauren Mayberry</a> of Churches at the Rose Bowl. I missed seeing her opener, <a href="https://toastmp3.bandcamp.com/album/supermodels">Claud</a> whose record is a gift to humanity.</li>
<li>YouTube concerts don’t count but my brother was at a very similar show to <a href="https://youtu.be/TolZh65YsmM?si=mGJnauI28TmKEXYv">Bon Iver at Pitchfork</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>One last note: we all heard a new Beatles song this year. Its authenticity is contentious but seeing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzcsKb8iLY&amp;pp=ygUZbm93IGFuZCB0aGVuIGNlbnRyYWwgcGFyaw%3D%3D">people singing <em>Now and Then</em> in Central Park</a> is something. It’s hard to imagine this song hasn’t been around for 50 years.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>I started supporting <a href="https://kottke.org">kottke.org</a> by becoming a <a href="https://kottke.org/members">member</a>. His site is an invaluable source of information on the internet across a variety of topics and help satiates my curiosity.</p>
<p>I read <em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/310896/expecting-better-by-emily-oster/">Expecting Better</a></em> which is the <em>Freakonomics</em> of pregnancy.</p>
<p>30 seconds into Apple’s trailer for <a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2023/06/apple-tv-renews-hit-world-building-drama-silo-for-season-two/"><em>Silo</em></a> and I was hooked. Before the show aired I read the first book, <em><a href="https://hughhowey.com/books/wool/">Wool</a></em>. I’m currently reading <em><a href="https://hughhowey.com/books/shift/">Shift</a></em>, book 2 of 3. If you’re a fan of the show, read the books.</p>
<p>(I <em>think</em> I read more than this but I don’t have a good tracking system.)</p>

<p>The ads are obnoxious. One ad repeats throughout the series has Malcom Gladwell reading (I kid you not) this banger ad-copy, “Apple Card: a credit card made by Apple.” Good gravy.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
