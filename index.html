			 <p>I was laid off a couple years ago. Long story short: the startup ran out of money. It was not ideal, of course, but I was able to join my wife‚Äôs health insurance and pick up some freelance work. I was OK.</p>
<p>A few months later I landed a job with John Deere and it‚Äôs been wonderful. I was not looking for or wanting a change, but it ended up working out <em>much</em> better for me financially and I love the work and enjoy working with so many super talented people.</p>
<p>I guess I just wanted to share that layoffs suck. If that‚Äôs happened to you recently: hang in there. I‚Äôm sure it will lead to new and better things.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>After months of listening to Manton Reece on <a href="https://coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a> I‚Äôve decided to move to <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>. My domain name will carry on but I‚Äôm not 100% sure if my RSS feed will transition gracefully? ü§∑ Worst case I‚Äôll let all 12 of you know with a final post in this feed.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>My current site is built with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> and while I‚Äôve enjoyed the experience of learning web development and entering the world of static site generators, I find there‚Äôs just too much friction with writing new posts ‚Äî especially from my phone.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> It‚Äôs enough friction where I tend to just post to Mastodon or sit on a pile of unused ideas for months.</p>
<p>In this process I‚Äôve learned that I enjoy writing. I like even more that I‚Äôm writing at a domain and site I control ‚Äî not some out-of-his-mind billionaire. What drew me to Eleventy was the idea that I could mooch indefinitely off of GitHub pages (free!) and only pay for my domain renewal fees. Unfortunately the convenience is just not there.</p>
<p>Enter Micro.blog which hosts your site, lets you blog, cross-post to Threads and Mastodon (and others), and podcast hosting (you never know!) for <a href="https://micro.blog/pricing">$5/mo</a>. I always have this fear of thinking of monthly costs for my website, which often goes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I want to have a website my whole life that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ hmm let me do the math‚Ä¶ $5 √ó 12 months per year √ó 90 years. Shit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the reality is that $5/mo is, at least for most people, nothing. This is ‚Äúcup of coffee‚Äù territory.</p>
<p>Micro.blog also has a social aspect, but without all the algorithms and engagement bait that makes using Threads or certain <em>unnamed</em> sites such a hellscape at times. I want to take this as an opportunity to rethink my relationship with social media more broadly.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm pumped to try Micro.blog and I can already tell I‚Äôm going to be a happy paying customer. We need more people like Manton building platforms based on the open web and I‚Äôm happy to support their work over there. Write on!</p>

			 <p>Dan Moren <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/11/m4-mac-mini-review-phenomenal-cosmic-power-itty-bitty-form-factor/">writing about the new Mac mini</a> with M4 and M4 Pro, writing at Six Colors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Ä¶ it&rsquo;s basically a smaller version of the Mac Studio, which was itself a taller version of the Mac mini. Time, as they say, is a flat squircle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dan Moren cracks me up.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I‚Äôm certainly tempted by the new Mac mini. I have a great desktop setup ‚Äî two displays, continuity camera, great speakers ‚Äî but the brains are a MacBook Pro (M1 Pro) in clamshell. It‚Äôs a great machine but you can always use faster when doing SwiftUI development.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd love a machine that‚Äôs always ready for me at the desk but my hangup is: do I really need two Macs? I feel like if I get the mini I need to trade in my laptop. There are times I want a Mac to-go though and Apple silicon MacBooks have almost zero compromises.</p>
<p>The correct decision is to <em>not buy anything</em>. We shall see.</p>

			 <p>I heard Nvidia overtook Apple as the most valuable company in the world today. Their insane growth has been driven by the need for GPUs to build data centers and models for companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta.</p>
<p>What I find interesting is that the CEO of Anthropic, Dario Amodei, <a href="https://darioamodei.com/machines-of-loving-grace">wrote an essay</a> where he stated that the next generation of AI will take somewhere around $100 billion to create. That‚Äôs a <em>lot</em> of money and it‚Äôs difficult to see the path from iterating on LLMs to get to &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo;. One very likely possibility is that companies like OpenAI run themselves into the ground chasing this fantasy.</p>
<p>All along the way, Nvidia will happily take their cash <strong>today</strong> selling GPUs who may go out in a burning blaze of glory burning the cash and energy to make the AI of <strong>tomorrow</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Regardless on your feelings of AI<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, you gotta hand it to Nvidia for leaning into this and being a critical ingredient for all these companies: they‚Äôll be the one left holding the bag.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Despite Coldplay‚Äôs new album <em>Moon Music</em> not coming out until Friday, I found a way to listen to it.</p>
<p>In a world where many people tune into endless playlists and mindless lo-fi music on YouTube, I‚Äôm an old school album guy. I love discovering new music but I can‚Äôt latch onto an artist without sinking my teeth into an album or an EP. The <em>album</em> is a work of art: What is its mood? What does this collection of songs in this particular order say about the people who made it and the time in which it‚Äôs made?</p>
<p>One of the things I‚Äôve always appreciated about Coldplay is their dedication to the album. It‚Äôs certain to be a commercially-driven strategy: the duration between albums, time spent on tour, and how long they drip and hype a new release is like clockwork. Each album is an era which its own unique art style, show, and through line.</p>
<p>That brings me to <em>Moon Music</em> (which is Coldplay‚Äôs second collaboration with Max Martin and billed as a follow-up to <em>Music of the Spheres</em>) which has a semblance of continuity, hung together loosely with what I would call <em>spacey</em> sounds and (like 99% of pop music) simple ideas about love.</p>
<p>Here are my thoughts after a first listen.</p>
<p>(Listen to this album with some good headphones, you‚Äôll thank me later.)</p>
<hr>
<p>It begins with a gorgeous intro, the titular <em>Moon Music</em>, from Jon Hopkins. To my knowledge it‚Äôs the first time he‚Äôs been credited as a ‚Äúfeaturing‚Ä¶‚Äù on a Coldplay track (as opposed to being relegated to liner notes) but he‚Äôs worked with Coldplay as far back as 2008‚Äôs opening track on <em>Viva La Vida</em>. The opener here too is absolutely brilliant and I was completely lost in it.</p>
<p><em>Feelslikeimfallinginlove</em> has a strange combination of having energy ‚Äî especially in the chorus ‚Äî while being a slow, low-key rhythmic vibe. It was a solid choice for a lead single.</p>
<p><em>We Pray</em> is a more successful version of <em>Princess of China</em> with Rihanna, or <em>Hymn for the Weekend</em> with Beyonc√©. I don‚Äôt know the artists featured but I enjoy how <em>different</em> this song feels and it has definitely grown on me.</p>
<p><em>Jupiter</em> is an absolute joy that fills your heart with an upbeat message. Ya gotta love the acoustic guitar and cello.</p>
<p><em>Good Feelings</em> with Arya Starr is a funky good time with a stellar guitar riff halfway in. It sounds like it could have been on Daft Punk‚Äôs <em>Random Access Memories</em> or on a Passion Pit record.</p>
<p><em>Rainbow</em> is filled with dreamy synths, ripping guitar, a beautiful piano interlude, and spoken audio from Maya Angelou reminds me of M83‚Äôs <em>Hurry Up We‚Äôre Dreaming</em>.</p>
<p><em>Iaam</em> (‚ÄúI Am a Mountain‚Äù) is like a throwback to <em>Glass of Water</em> from 2009 but without the heart. The mix itself is hollow: tonally, lyrically, and energy. It stays at one level the whole time.</p>
<p><em>Aeterna</em> is a groovy tune my brother. I‚Äôm looking forward to hearing <em>many</em> remixes that take this jam to full-on EDM music. Nice vocal outro too. (I think they played this live at Glastonbury and it looked like a rockin‚Äô time.)</p>
<p><em>All My Love</em> is a classic, piano-centric Coldplay love song with a great string ensemble. It feels like this song has been in the air forever yet is somehow new. (Reminds me of their demo of <em>Wedding Bells</em> many moons ago.) I wanna sit down at the piano and learn it.</p>
<p><em>One World</em> has vamping synths, piano, guitar which fall away to a hundred humming voices then trails to <em>another</em> breathtaking string piece. Some Pink Floyd vibes at the very beginning then goes straight to M83 for its crescendo.</p>
<p>(The outro had me wondering if they forgot to come back and record the words ‚Äî but there‚Äôs also something charming in its rawness.)</p>
<hr>
<p>There‚Äôs a lot of variety in <em>Moon Music</em> and a lot to like. Musically there are some <strong>incredible</strong> moments, especially in the more complex instrumental compositions. Lyrically it left me wanting with two too many songs rely on ‚Äúla la la‚Äù as a chorus.</p>
<p>As a continuous listening experience, it moves nicely throughout but there‚Äôs an unevenness. (The incongruity from <em>We Pray</em> to <em>Jupiter</em> is a bit of whiplash.)</p>
<p>To be sure, there is some beautiful music here (if you like Coldplay) but time will tell if this is a good <em>album</em> that stands out in the annals of time like <em>Viva la Vida</em>. Maybe by my tenth listen I can check back in.</p>
<p>My first listen was laying in bed with headphones and I‚Äôm looking forward to hearing it on my speakers tomorrow for a totally different listening experience.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://seths.blog/2024/09/twenty-questions/">Seth Godin‚Äôs 20 Questions</a> post has some good considerations for starting a new project. I think it‚Äôs mostly in the context of consulting but I‚Äôve been thinking about this as a solo app developer.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I have an idea for a simple (in theory) app but I‚Äôve been having a hard time deciding if I should even start it or not. I haven‚Äôt yet had the time or skills to make MapKeep fully featured and I feel like I‚Äôd be leaving it unfinished. At best my time would now be split between two apps (and all my other interests, such as my child and gaming).</p>
<p>The upside of starting this new idea? It <em>could</em> have a broader appeal than MapKeep and I think more likely to made some <strong>coin</strong>. (That‚Äôs not my main goal but it‚Äôs always in the back of my capitalistic mind.)</p>
<p>Big picture is I often wonder how others seem to juggle so many projects and I feel like I can‚Äôt measure up to them. Erving Goffman would say something like <em>don‚Äôt compare someone else‚Äôs frontstage to your backstage</em>.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://spyglass.org/apple-knew-where-the-puck-was-going-but-meta-skated-there/">M.G. Siegler tosses out a few interesting ideas</a> for how Apple Vision Pro could be re-envisioned as accessory to the iPhone. Let the iPhone be the brains and the battery for headset and have <em>that</em> be the tethered thing (instead of that jumbo battery).</p>
<p>The hole there is that ultra low-latency for passthrough mode is essential so people don‚Äôt get motion sick (and so you could play ping pong) while wearing it. Maybe that could have been solved to some degree, but I assume the physical proximity from silicon to display is a key factor.</p>
<p>Overall I like spitballing on ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios for Apple Vision Pro successors and Siegler has some good points. I am intrigued by products like the <a href="https://www.xreal.com/us/">XREAL</a> glasses for projecting my Switch or iPhone and less keen on an entire new computing platform.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Thanks to Louie Mantia for his <a href="https://lmnt.me/blog/dark-mode-app-icons.html">dark mode app icons blog post</a>. He inspired me to use a sunset in the background (as opposed to Apple‚Äôs <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons#iOS-iPadOS">default gradient</a>) which strikes a nice balance between fitting in and standing out.</p>
<p>I hadn‚Äôt touched the artwork for the app icon since 1.0 last summer so it was fun to get back in there and experiment with color and transparency for these new variants.</p>

			 <p>I‚Äôve been busy with making a few substantial updates to MapKeep this summer so I avoided touching the betas. The main item on my todo list is supporting the new app icon tinting and I‚Äôm glad I waited. It‚Äôs great seeing what many apps have done, courtesy of the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-18-the-macstories-review/3/">App Icon chapter</a> in Federico Viticci‚Äôs iOS 18 review. Now I have some fresh ideas and hope to release something in the next week or so.</p>
<p><em>Update September 20, 2024:</em> After using iOS 18 more I‚Äôve noticed how glaring apps look that don&rsquo;t support the new icon styles. It‚Äôs not for me, at least not yet, but it shines a big light on apps that don&rsquo;t update. Some will translate just fine but more colorful icons like NetNewsWire and my own just get lazily darkened by 20%. iOS 13, when Dark Mode was introduced, was not <strong>this</strong> noticeable: now without even opening apps you can see which apps have done the work and which haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt begrudge Apple with how they rolled this out, just an observation.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>While the majority of complaints in <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/07/26/swiftdata-and-core-data-at-wwdc24/">Michael Tsai‚Äôs post</a> go way over my head, I kinda regret adopting SwiftData in <a href="/mapkeep">MapKeep</a>. I felt adopting the latest technology was best for the longterm health of the app and I‚Äôd kick myself in 5 years when I feel burdened by a ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù technology like CoreData.</p>
<p>There have been upsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>I enjoy that the data model is <strong>expressed in Swift</strong> (as opposed to the strange PLIST-esque CoreData thing).</li>
<li>It gave me <strong>iCloud Sync</strong> with almost no work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here‚Äôs my pain points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding <strong>dynamic filtering</strong> to <a href="/blog/2024/mapkeep-1-3">MapKeep in 1.3</a> was a huge pain and added a <em>lot</em> of complexity. Without <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/maintaining-a-local-copy-of-server-data">Apple‚Äôs DataCache</a> sample project, there is <em>zero</em> chance I would have figured this out. iOS 18 appears to improve predicates, but I‚Äôve yet to jump on the latest here to see if it would have made things smoother.</li>
<li><strong>iCloud Sharing</strong> is not supported. I was disappointed to learn this last summer but I figured: hey SwiftData is brand-new, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll get to it next year. Well here we are a year later and they <strong>did not</strong> add iCloud Sharing in iOS 18. Now we wait for WWDC 2025?</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>By contrast, going all-in with SwiftUI last year worked out great. There were a few headaches and a couple things that were <em>impossible</em> to customize, but altogether I feel like it‚Äôs a mature UI system (at least on iOS and watchOS).</p>
<p>I‚Äôm sitting here feeling I might have been better off sticking with tried-and-true CoreData and <em>eventually</em> migrating to SwiftData when it felt more fully-baked.</p>

			 <p>I launched an update to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833">MapKeep</a> this weekend which brings an all-new design. It has a list and map that stay in sync: selecting something on the map shows it in the list. Date filters are also improved.</p>
<p>The previous design was all-map which made it nice to <em>view</em> your collection but difficult to <em>explore</em> your locations chronologically. The app has been out for almost a year now so I wanted to make sure it could handle large collections.</p>
<p>I debated calling this ‚ÄúVersion 2.0‚Äù because it was effectively a <strong>full rewrite</strong> of the iPhone app and brought a substantially new experience. However, from a user‚Äôs standpoint: this basically just adds a list! So I‚Äôll hold onto that for a bit longer.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs something in your life that you‚Äôd like to track easily. So <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833">check out MapKeep</a>. (It‚Äôs free!)</p>
<p>For inspiration: here‚Äôs a couple real world examples of how it‚Äôs used:</p>
<ul>
<li>A friend of mine moved to a new city and they capture spots in town (parks, neighborhoods, restaurants) to come back to later.</li>
<li>A family member wants to use it anytime they get a birdie on the golf course to mark the occasion.</li>
<li>Tracking where your dog does a number 2 on walks ;-)</li>

			 <p>I don‚Äôt have a fully formed opinion on how much of what Suno‚Äôs tools are just traditional ‚Äúremixing‚Äù or sampling but this sentiment expressed in <a href="https://suno.com/blog/future-of-music">their blog post</a> as a response to their RIAA lawsuit is ridiculous:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Ä¶ like the kid writing their own rock songs after listening to the genre ‚Ä¶ learning is not infringing. It never has been, and it is not now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs obvious what the difference is, right? One is a computer absorbing millions of songs and one is a <strong>human</strong>. Computers don‚Äôt have rights.</p>
<p>They also justify their actions by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We train our models on ‚Ä¶ music we can find on the open internet &ndash; just as Google&rsquo;s Gemini, Microsoft&rsquo;s Copilot, Anthropic&rsquo;s Claude, OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT, and even Apple&rsquo;s new Apple Intelligence train their models on the open internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is akin to a toddler saying, ‚Äúthe other kids are doing it, why am <em>I</em> in trouble?‚Äù</p>
<p>I am not pro- Big Record Label. I want people to make music and I bet Suno‚Äôs tools are neat but these are kid-level logical arguments that don‚Äôt hold water. I look forward to seeing what happens next.</p>

			 <p>I learned about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/31/24210304/wix-ai-website-builder-seo-blog-posts">Wix‚Äôs new blog-writing tools</a> thanks to a post by Jess Weatherbed at The Verge.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> This will enable <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/11/style/ai-search-slop.html">slop</a> at massive scale. Heaps of garbage written by a machine to <em>hopefully</em> appease Google‚Äôs algorithms and trick people into thinking this site is written by another human. Wix‚Äôs large presence in the webhosting world means this has the potential to be an all-out assault on a human-led internet. I hope they reconsider this endeavor.</p>
<p>On a similar note:</p>
<p>My wife, who‚Äôs far less tuned-in to the AI-hype world than me, was equally grossed-out by <a href="https://youtu.be/NgtHJKn0Mck?si=NBFRh2Qlt7duUFab">Google‚Äôs ad during the Olympics</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> where a father encourages his child to use Gemini to <em>write a letter to their hero</em>.</p>
<p>How would you feel if you found out a disingenuous robot wrote a ‚Äúheartfelt‚Äù letter to you?</p>
<p>Luckily we <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/30/nx-s1-5056201/google-olympics-ai-ad">weren‚Äôt the only people</a> who picked up on this detail and it went viral (in a bad way). Similar to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntjkwIXWtrc">Apple‚Äôs <em>Crush</em> ad</a>, I struggle to understand how this ad made it into the world. Did no one at these companies raise their hand to say, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this gross?‚Äù</p>
<p>Upon seeing Apple‚Äôs Image Playgrounds at WWDC the same word came to mind: <em>gross</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh it looks like you made a lovely hand drawn sketch of a building? Let‚Äôs turn it to a super-fake, oversaturated, clearly-made-by-a-computer-abomination with one easy tap!</li>
<li>Want a hyper-ugly-Pixar knockoff of your mom? Bon app√©tit.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>I worry, <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected/509">as others do</a>, that if we let machines create for us we‚Äôll never learn how to create for ourselves. <strong>I</strong> write to become a <em>better writer</em> and to share <em>my</em> thoughts.</p>
<p>To clarify: I‚Äôm not against AI in its entirety. I‚Äôm not happy that every LLM-maker decided they could violate copyright and scrape the whole web. I‚Äôm concerned that more companies like <a href="https://tidbits.com/2024/07/29/reddit-blocks-indexing-by-search-engines-other-than-google/">Reddit will withdraw from searched indexes unless paid</a>.</p>
<p>But I do think AI can be uniquely talented at <em>editing</em>. Someone who‚Äôs over my shoulder and can suggest ways to elevate my work, connect it to other things, and make me more efficient. Apple‚Äôs Writing Tools (if they work) skate the razor-thin line between creating and editing. The litmus test, I feel, is that they only ever make your text <em>shorter</em>, never <em>longer</em>.</p>
<p>To all the companies out there working on half-assed AI integrations: please redirect your focus to editing. Empower humans to be creative. Don‚Äôt fill the world with slop. I‚Äôm open to applauding and adopting AI but they have to help me. Not try to be me.</p>

			 <p>As a listener (and supporting <a href="https://atp.fm/join">member</a>) of <a href="https://atp.fm/">Accidental Tech Podcast</a> I‚Äôve been hearing about Overcast‚Äôs big rewrite for a while now.</p>
<p>On its 10th Anniversary the big update for <a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a> is finally here! <a href="https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite">Marco</a> did an amazing job modernizing the app‚Äôs design while setting the foundation for faster feature updates in the future. I‚Äôm excited to see where it goes from here.</p>
<p>My favorite new feature is one I‚Äôve requested: Sleep Timer can be set to <em>End of Chapter</em>. I can now drift off to sleep and not miss the beginning of the next topic.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre interested in app development I encourage you to listen to <a href="https://www.relay.fm/radar/297">Under the Radar 297</a> or <a href="https://atp.fm/596">ATP 596</a>. There were a few tidbits that stood out to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="https://www.relay.fm/radar/293">Radar 293</a> Marco shared that a project manager helped him plan, prioritize, sequence, and define the scope for this project. It reminds me that even a team of one can benefit from a good project manager.</li>
<li>I don‚Äôt know Marco personally but it was <em>gut-wrenching</em> to hear that the burden of this rewrite (and his mountain of technical debt) made Marco consider quitting programming altogether. It was equally <em>inspiring</em> to hear he‚Äôs now feeling better than ever and ready for what‚Äôs next.</li>
<li>He migrated user data to an all-new backend in parallel (APFS style) with the <em>previous</em> version of the app to make the transition seamless for customers day one (and to lighten the server load).</li>
<li>He removed streaming (used by about 8% of users) due to increased complexity in how podcast files are hosted (namely: dynamic ad insertion). The downside isn‚Äôt huge: just a few extra seconds to wait after hitting play (if you don‚Äôt use automatic downloads). Upside: Marco won‚Äôt be burdened with bugs and can spend more time improving the app.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use the app I encourage you to leave a nice review (or a quick 5 star rating) for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/overcast/id888422857">Overcast in the App Store</a>. A nice review goes a long way and it pays dividends to send good vibes.</p>

			 <p>Can you believe this shit?

			 <p>I took advantage of the long Fourth of July weekend to work on <a href="/mapkeep/">MapKeep</a>. Don&rsquo;t worry: I was able to enjoy the beautiful weather from our back porch. I shipped <a href="/blog/2024/mapkeep-1-2/">version 1.2</a> <em>right</em> before our daughter was born but since then we haven&rsquo;t had the <del>time</del> brain power to do side projects. I‚Äôm testing an all-new design inspired by Apple‚Äôs <a href="https://www.apple.com/icloud/find-my/">Find My</a> which should unlock some new interactions (and expand to iPadOS/macOS).</p>
<p><del>Sadly</del> I‚Äôve taken this as an opportunity to completely rewrite the app. I‚Äôve learned <em>a lot</em> since last summer. For example, I couldn‚Äôt figure how to get SwiftUI Previews working in my main view because it needed a fake array of SwiftData objects. Well I took the time to <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftdata/how-to-use-swiftdata-in-swiftui-previews">figure that out</a> (thanks to Paul Hudson) and now I can iterate way faster. There‚Äôs a <strong>ton</strong> of optimizations like this that add up.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not sure this new design is a slam dunk: I&rsquo;m trying to get a feel for it by using it daily. Even if I revert to the old design the code will be in a <em>much</em> better place.</p>
<p>Tinkering with a new design is a fun distraction :-) but I probably should be thinking about iOS 18 features like <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons#Platform-considerations">Dark Mode app icons</a> and App Intents<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> ahead of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppIntents/Integrating-your-app-with-siri-and-apple-intelligence">Apple Intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>As a newbie app developer I hit a <strong>lot</strong> of brick walls. It can be truly frustrating. But when I figure it out, it feels like flying.</p>

			 <p>I <a href="/blog/2024/dad">became a dad</a> in May. You could say it‚Äôs been a pretty big couple months. I‚Äôll <em>never</em> forget that feeling of the first time I held her.</p>
<p>April was a nesting and prepping month, May was a monumental adjustment: waking up every two hours to help feed and change the baby was a <em>bit</em> taxing on the old noggin. As June rolled in the nights started getting easier and easier. I had a month off from work and will take more time in the Fall when my partner‚Äôs leave concludes. (I‚Äôm bitterly jealous of my German colleagues with 1 or 2 year parental leave options. I‚Äôm also grateful we get anything at all.)</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a few bits of media I squeezed in. As you can see it‚Äôs quite a bit less than <a href="/blog/2024/q1">Q1</a>!</p>
<h2 id="games">Games</h2>
<p>My relationship with gaming is probably going to look a lot different going forward now that I have a kid: you rarely have two hands free for a controller with a newborn (let alone the time). I‚Äôm so glad my phone can be a Pok√©mon machine now and being able to steal a few minutes away or play one-handed while I hold my sleeping kid is such a joy.</p>
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôm almost done playing through <em>Pok√©mon Crystal</em> (well, technically <a href="https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal">Polished Crystal</a>) in Delta and have published a couple <a href="https://deltastyles.com/user/92-andrewhaglund">custom controller skins</a>. Having a go-to game on your phone is a sure-fire way to stay off social media.</li>
<li>Played a little of <em>Hades 2</em> in early access (it‚Äôs phenomenal) on my Steam Deck and am looking forward to diving in again.</li>
<li>I picked up <em>Paper Mario: Thousand Year Door</em> remake for the Switch and have been slowly working my way through it. (For context I just stared Chapter 1.) I played the original a long time ago and have fond memories.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@haglund/112559467713943204">modded my Gamesir G8 controller</a> to work with my new iPad. It‚Äôs a glorious combination.</p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>Been enjoying new music from Vampire Weekend, Iron &amp; Wine, Hovvdy, Decemberists, Billie Eilish, and of course Taylor Swift.</p>
<p>Looking forward to new Bright Eyes and Coldplay in Q3. Speaking of Coldplay: I think they played <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kr82k58qqo">their best concert ever at Glastonbury</a>. It was an incredibly special performance with a lot of heart. Knowing 100k people were there in-person seeing what I was seeing at the <em>exact save time</em> was awe-inspiring.</p>
<h2 id="movies--tv">Movies &amp; TV</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Bad Batch</em> (season 3) went out with a bang. Love a good star war.</li>
<li><em>30 Rock</em> (seasons 1‚Äì3) is sublime. To me it‚Äôs like a live-action cartoon and I am always here for the zaniness. Blink and you might miss three jokes. I just love Tracy Morgan, Jack McBrayer, and <em>everyone</em> in the cast. (Some jokes haven‚Äôt aged well but that‚Äôs kind of how comedy works.) ‚òÖ</li>
<li>My wife is rewatching <em>Modern Family</em> and I‚Äôll catch a few episodes here and there. Holy hell. That show deserve all its Emmys, it‚Äôs such a treat.</li>
<li><em>Fargo</em> (season 3) was good but nothing like seasons 1 and 2 (which were <em>outstanding</em>). We watched an episode of season 4 and kinda bailed on it. I like <em>Fargo</em> for the relatable characters ‚Äî not the organized crime.</li>
<li>The last season of <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em> (season 12) was fantastic. They nailed the finale. Pretty, <em>pretty</em> good.</li>
<li><em>Chernobyl</em> (2019) was a rewatch for me. My wife never saw it and I was itching to rewatch it. It‚Äôs an amazing feat of film and one of the all-time greats.</li>
<li><em>Demetri Martin: Demetri Deconstructed</em> was humorous and surreal. Interesting editing and pacing of a live standup session.</li>
<li><em>BlackBerry</em> was excellent and such a funny and amazing ‚Äútrue story‚Äù movie. It makes you realize how far our current technology has come (and how amazing the iPhone is). I‚Äôd love to see Glenn Howerton in more serious roles going forward. ‚òÖ</li>
<li><em>Dream Scenario</em> was a classic A24 film and Nic Cage was great. While I liked it I couldn‚Äôt help but think that I was just watching an extended version of the trailer. It‚Äôs all in there, weirdly enough.</li>
<li><em>Conan O‚ÄôBrien Must Go</em> was a great laugh. Always been a fan of him and it‚Äôs fun seeing him have fun. ‚òÖ</li>
<li><em>Little Women</em> (2019) was great. I‚Äôm not sure why we watched this now ‚Äî¬†it might have been suggested in Hulu or something ‚Äî but it‚Äôs a delightful movie. I was in a stage adaptation of this in high school (I can‚Äôt remember who I played) so I‚Äôll always have a soft spot for this tale. (It was also interesting watching this after seeing <em>Barbie</em> since it was Gerwig‚Äôs previous project.)</li>
<li><em>Castle in the Sky</em> is a masterpiece. Watching this made me realize how much <em>Zelda</em> borrows from Ghibli‚Äôs humor and style ‚Äî everything from the nature, creatures, music, and floating cities were all just sitting there.</li>
<li><em>Unfrosted</em> felt like an odd halfway between a kid‚Äôs movie and something for older audience. Not sure who this movie was for‚Ä¶? Just a big sugar-high mess of cameos. (Jack McBrayer and the <em>Mad Men</em> scene make it worthwhile in my book.) If this didn‚Äôt have Seinfeld attached there‚Äôs no way I would have watched it.</li>
<li><em>Clueless</em> (1995) I <em>think</em> I had seen this once before but not sure. It was a fine romcom. Not sure how Paul Rudd still looks the same.</li>
</ul>

<p>As always I want to thank Shawn Hickman for making <a href="https://www.sofahq.com/">Sofa</a>. I use it to queue up media and log when I‚Äôve watched/played it.</p>

			 <p>MacRumors has a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/07/apple-intelligence-service-wwdc/">roundup of AI features</a> expected to be announced by Apple on Monday during the WWDC 2024 keynote. There‚Äôs a lot of buzz around AI (especially in the stock market where Nvidia is <a href="https://spyglass.org/nvidia-3-trillion/">suddenly valued</a> around $3 trillion which is in within spitting distance of Apple and Microsoft, two companies which make <em>way</em> more money).</p>
<p>There‚Äôs an over-abundance of hype and I expect there to be quite the comedown when this bubble bursts. Recent mainstream events like <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/20/1252495087/openai-pulls-ai-voice-that-was-compared-to-scarlett-johansson-in-the-movie-her">Scarlett Johansson‚Äôs kerfuffle with OpenAI</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd11gzejgz4o">Google telling people to eat rocks and glue</a> put a spotlight on the ethical and technical issues with AI technology and the companies hawking these new-fangled products.</p>
<p>Putting that aside for a moment, I am extremely optimistic for what Apple can bring to this space. I enjoy talking with ChatGPT via voice (and subsequent fact checking it) and using it to help me code but I think AI will remain a party trick until it‚Äôs fully embedded in our phones and computers.</p>
<p>Things like the Apple Photos widget and iOS 17‚Äôs autocorrect <em>are already AI</em> and I think there‚Äôs hundreds of ways that AI could help us get things done on our computers in new and faster ways. So count me in as someone who is very excited to see what we‚Äôll get on Monday.</p>
<p>But don‚Äôt get <em>too</em> excited. I think iOS 18 will just be the start of a long journey to incorporate these new technologies into our operating systems. I think we‚Äôre going to be surprised and impressed come Monday but also let down. Both things can be true. There‚Äôs too much hype and anticipation for Apple to solve everything in one year.</p>

			 <p>Our new car has wired CarPlay. That may sound like a crime against humanity in 2024 but I actually prefer it over wireless (mostly). A cable means it is <em>absolutely</em> rock solid and straightforward to switch between devices.</p>
<p>However I have a USB-C iPhone and my wife has a absolute garbage antiquated Lighting iPhone (jk it‚Äôs a one-year-old iPhone 14). This posed an issue where we‚Äôd need to swap cables when we switched drivers in the car. I also didn‚Äôt like the idea of wearing out the car‚Äôs built in USB plug switching cables frequently. Is that an irrational thing to worry about? Yes.</p>
<p>So the solution we landed on is keeping a USB-C cable always plugged into the car for my phone. (I drive most often, especially now that we have a <a href="/blog/2024/dad">baby</a> my wife likes to sit in the back now) and when she needs to plug in we attach this tiny <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0BRV6LWYN?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title">female USB-C to male Lightning dingus</a> to the end of the USB-C cable and voil√† her phone is charging and connected to CarPlay. I was worried this cable would only handle charging bht it definitely works for tranferring the data required for CarPlay. This solution also keeps the console less cluttered ‚Äî we don‚Äôt need two 3 foot cables strewn about getting tangled and driving me nuts.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm probably going to buy another to charge my keyboard at my desk. I like having an open USB-C cable at all times for charging things and I still have a few Lightning accessories. Slowly yet surely we are eradicating Lightning from our home. It‚Äôs a battle I‚Äôm ready to endure for as long as it shall take.</p>

			 <p>A few weeks ago I became a father.</p>
<p>I can‚Äôt begin to explain how wonderful it was hearing our baby‚Äôs cry for the first time. Compared to the work my wife put in, I was just a lowly bystander but I can confidently say bringing a kid into this world is a stressful proposition ‚Äî the 9 months of pregnancy, the hospital stay, labor, all of it ‚Äî but it all just <em>melts away</em> when you hear that baby cry and it‚Äôs you and your partner and this beautiful tiny thing.</p>
<p>In a flash everything changes and you‚Äôre filled to the absolute brim with overwhelming joy.</p>
<p>My wife‚Äôs parents and my parents and brother came to the hospital the day after to meet our baby. We couldn‚Äôt be more lucky to have their love and support. I‚Äôm on cusp of returning to work but in the past few weeks we‚Äôve established a decent rhythm and am starting to get more sleep.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs absolutely true what they say about the first couple weeks. It was hard running on scraps of sleep and having the day sliced into two-hour increments. Even now that feels like a hazy memory. You just stay calm, sleep when they sleep, and soak it all in.</p>
<p>The three of us are doing great and we‚Äôve been bombarded with visitors, FaceTime calls, and gifts from close friends and family. Most crucially our neighbor graciously bought us a two weeks of <a href="https://www.daily-harvest.com">meal subscription food</a> to make <em>our</em> feedings as smooth as possible.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm the absolute luckiest and I can‚Äôt wait to see who our kid becomes.</p>
<p>To close things out, here‚Äôs a quote my wife printed (and framed in the kid‚Äôs nursery) from our favorite author, Kurt Vonnegut:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello babies. Welcome to Earth. It‚Äôs hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It‚Äôs round and wet and crowded. On the outside, babies, you‚Äôve got a hundred years here. There‚Äôs only one rule that I know of, babies ‚Äî ‚ÄúGod damn it, you‚Äôve got to be kind.‚Äù</p>

			<h1><a href="https://haglund.micro.blog/2024/05/28/the-trials-and.html">The Trials and Tribulations of Creating Delta Skins on iPadOS</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://haglund.micro.blog/2024/05/28/the-trials-and.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-05-28 18:00:00 -0600">May 28, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I decided to work on <a href="https://github.com/AndrewHaglund/delta-absorb">Absorb</a>, my <a href="https://noah978.gitbook.io/delta-docs/skins">custom Gameboy skin</a> for the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688">Delta emulator</a>, from my shiny new 11-inch iPad Pro. There‚Äôs been a lot of conversation around what the iPad can and cannot do so I thought I‚Äôd give this a try. This is <em>fairly</em> complex work involving designing in Figma, editing JSON files, managing files, and committing code to GitHub. Let‚Äôs see how the experiment went.</p>
<h2 id="figma">Figma</h2>
<p>Designing in Figma on iPadOS is a bit of a cluster. Their marketing claims it works great in ‚Äúany browser‚Äù but apparently that generous definition does not extend to Safari for iPad. If you use it directly in the browser you get weird behavior. For example, pinching with your fingers will zoom the canvas where pinching on a trackpad will zoom the entire web page. There is <a href="https://figurative.design/">Figurative</a> but this has its own tradeoffs: if I left and came back it would force reload the file because it was ‚Äúout of memory‚Äù and irritatingly ‚åòc and ‚åòv don‚Äôt work. Generally it felt like wearing mittens ‚Äî the iPadOS cursor is great but it still feels like a small meaty pointer and not the precise pointer you find on macOS.</p>
<p>Critically dealing with custom fonts is a mess on iPadOS. <a href="https://blog.iconfactory.com/2020/06/introducing-fontcase/">Fontcase</a> by the Iconfactory folks is great but it lives within Apple‚Äôs barbaric iPadOS font system. I used <a href="https://developer.apple.com/fonts/">SF Pro Rounded</a> for my button labels and I completely bailed on trying to get this onto iPad. Apple provides these fonts in a macOS Installer within a <code>.dmg</code> file, which is to decidedly <em>not</em> iPadOS-friendly. How does Figma handle missing fonts? Well by making text uneditable. Fun.</p>
<p>Exporting PDFs out of Figma into the Files app worked great and I was able to get a lot of design work done from my iPad. It was slow-going and the font issue ultimately drove me back to the Mac.</p>
<p>I have an itch to try making a Figma plugin to make it super easy to create Delta skins. That‚Äôs for another day though.</p>
<h2 id="editing-json">Editing JSON</h2>
<p>Delta‚Äôs skin system is pretty straightforward. You provide PDFs of the UI your users will see and then give the coordinates of all the buttons in a JSON file. This mapping can get unwieldy though as each device and orientation is all within a single JSON file. (It would be kind of nice if each PDF had its own JSON to make these files way more manageable.)</p>
<p>On the Mac and other desktop platforms there‚Äôs VS Code for code editing and committing code to GitHub. It‚Äôs fantastic. It has a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM4Vhrk4irY">sticky scrolling</a> feature which means you don‚Äôt lose your context. Even still it can be a pain doing all this text entry and all too often I‚Äôd forget a <code>,</code> or a <code>:</code> and everything would break!</p>
<p>VS Code is nowhere to be found on iPadOS and I could not find a text editor for iPad that had this sticky scrolling feature‚Ä¶ but I ran into Simon St√∏vring‚Äôs <a href="https://jayson.app">Jayson</a> (ha) app for editing JSON files with a GUI. This is far more approachable as you no longer need to think of the syntax for JSON and making a mistake. But it also involved a lot of navigating in-and-out due to the hierarchy of Delta‚Äôs skin system (where you have to drill into <code>dictionary 0</code> to see it‚Äôs the ‚ÄúA‚Äù button then back out to adjust its coordinates). Using this was better than typing manually, for sure, but I think there‚Äôs a lot of opportunity for Simon to optimize this app for fewer clicks and faster navigating up-and-down the hierarchy.</p>
<p>This app is also available on macOS but it‚Äôs a bare-minimum Catalyst version of the iPad app. (Sorry if I sound negative! I‚Äôm glad it exists on macOS but this was a rare case where the superior experience was definitely on iPad.)</p>
<p>This part of the process is a huge fun suck but that‚Äôs not the iPad‚Äôs fault.</p>
<h2 id="managing-files">Managing Files</h2>
<p>Technically a Delta skin is just a renamed ZIP file of a JSON file and some PDFs. I downloaded a <a href="https://noah978.gitbook.io/delta-docs/skins">template</a> to get started, exported my designs as PDFs from Figma to the Files app, edited the JSON file in Jayson, and was able to select the files, compress, and change the extension from <code>.zip</code> to <code>.deltaSkin</code>. Pretty easy. I didn‚Äôt have any issues with the Files app other than some slow exports from Figurative.</p>
<h2 id="committing-code-to-github">Committing Code to GitHub</h2>
<p>I chose to host my files as an <a href="https://github.com/AndrewHaglund/delta-absorb">open source project on GitHub</a>. The big asterisk here is that my Figma files are not <em>yet</em> public. While I‚Äôll host these themes on Gumroad and <a href="https://deltastyles.com">DeltaStyles</a> for discoverability I thought it was in the spirt of Delta emulator itself being <a href="https://github.com/rileytestut/Delta">open source</a> that my files are ‚Äúout there‚Äù for anyone.</p>
<p>Doing all the file management of creating the skins (zipping, renaming, editing JSON, exporting PDFs) meant that I wanted a good git client. Turns out there is <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com">Working Copy</a> by <a href="https://indieapps.space/@palmin@mastodon.social">Anders Borum</a>! I happily paid $25. It stings a <em>little</em> knowing VS Code is free on macOS and it handles everything I need, but this Working Copy is a powerhouse. (I‚Äôll be able to use this app for posting to my blog so it‚Äôs not just a one-time cost.)</p>
<p>After committing changes on my iPad I was able to iteratively test and debug my new GBA skin on my iPhone by sending it over AirDrop, make changes on iPad, send over, commit my work, and so on until I got everything working just right.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>While I had to fallback to the Mac for the design part ‚Äî partly due to wanting a bigger screen and iPadOS font limitations ‚Äî I was able to do most of this work from my iPad.</p>
<p>This is an exciting prospect as I tend to keep my MacBook Pro docked at my desk as a ‚Äúdesktop laptop.‚Äù This makes my iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard a perfect ‚Äúaround the house‚Äù machine. If I‚Äôm doing some online shopping I can leave the keyboard and just use this lovely big screen. If I want to get some serious work done or write a blog post from the back porch, I snap on the keyboard. If I want to plan some electrical upgrades and need to doodle a bit ‚Äî I grab the Apple Pencil.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs kind of an amazing device and it echoes the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/modular-computer/">modular computing idea</a> Federico is always going on about. (Next up is getting it to work with my Gamesir G8 controller. Currently I‚Äôm using this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZBRG92Z?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details">90-degree female-to-male USB-C cable</a>.)</p>
<p>I think my future experimentations might lie in building an app or something to automate the tedious JSON creation for Delta skins. Designing these is a lot of fun. Editing JSON is not.</p>
<p>In summary here are my main complaints with iPadOS for this workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figma is not good on iPadOS. I‚Äôm not sure if this is a Safari problem or Figma but it‚Äôs kind of a huge let down that it doesn‚Äôt work well ‚Äî even with a mouse and keyboard.</li>
<li>Apple‚Äôs own SF fonts are impossible to install from an iPad.</li>
<li>It would be remarkable if VS Code came to iPad. It‚Äôs an amazing IDE. I‚Äôm glad Working Copy exists but this would be a big game changer.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Lastly: If you‚Äôre playing retro games on your iPhone as much as I am, take a look at my custom skin, <a href="https://github.com/AndrewHaglund/delta-absorb">Absorb</a>, for Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance. They‚Äôre great for nighttime playing! Just download the <code>.deltaSkin</code> files and go into Delta‚Äôs settings to install.</p>

		<a href="https://haglund.micro.blog/2024/05/12/mapkeep.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-05-12 18:00:00 -0600">May 12, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yesterday I launched version 1.2 of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833">MapKeep</a> ‚Äî an iPhone and Apple Watch app that lets you capture your current location in one tap ‚Äî with a few useful features.</p>
<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>
<p>Since adding the ‚Äúlong press to add‚Äù feature in version 1.1 I‚Äôve wanted a <strong>satellite view</strong> of the map to give a better sense of where to place the pin. In 1.2 you can now switch to satellite view using the map style button.</p>
<p>After using the app for 6 months, my map was super cluttered with all the pins I‚Äôve saved. (Especially on Apple Watch!) This update adds <strong>date filters</strong>. Just look for the calendar button on the map.</p>
<p>Neither feature are fully baked ‚Äî the date options aren‚Äôt ideal and your options don‚Äôt persist between sessions ‚Äî but I had a specific timeline<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> in mind to get this update out the door.</p>
<h2 id="other-enhancements">Other Enhancements</h2>
<p>I wanted to improve how the app works when the user hasn‚Äôt granted location access. Previously the map was completely blocked if location access was denied. This didn‚Äôt sit right with me for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>With 1.1‚Äôs ‚Äúlong press to add‚Äù you don‚Äôt <em>technically</em> need location permission to use the app.</li>
<li>If you created pins <em>then</em> denied location access, it was impossible to view (or export) your collection.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the app feels more seamless than before; the splashy request location view gets replaced with the ‚Äúadd‚Äù button after location is permitted. Simple. Even though the app is completely private, I wanted to go above and beyond here.</p>
<h2 id="bugs">Bugs</h2>
<p>Lastly it seems like a <a href="https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/748996">SwiftUI bug</a> was introduced in iOS 17.3 or 17.4 having to do with using <code>@Environment</code> with <code>modelContainer</code>. If you created a pin on Apple Watch it would wake up the iPhone app in the background to sync with iCloud then crash silently in the background. I have a workaround to fix this but it‚Äôs not ideal.</p>
<h2 id="wrapup">Wrapup</h2>
<p>The theme here is that I‚Äôm glad I shipped this update but I feel like there‚Äôs a lot of room for improvement. I hope to chip away at this before WWDC hits early June. Time will tell.</p>

			 <p>I haven‚Äôt updated <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833">MapKeep</a> in a while but I‚Äôve been plugging away at a nice update.

<p>Two things urged me to get back into the swing of things:</p>
<ol>
<li>After making a couple tweaks and sending to TestFlight, my iPhone app would crash <em>every single time</em> I created a location in the Apple Watch version. Annoying!</li>
<li>My wife is having our first kid in roughly‚Ä¶ 10 days! I‚Äôve heard a tiny rumor that kids can be time-consuming? It‚Äôd be great to get the update out the door before it goes back on the shelf.</li>
</ol>
<p>One <em>could</em> call this motivation. Another less healthy term would be anxiety or obsession. I get this reeling feeling of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have to do this, I have to do this, I have to do this‚Ä¶</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I put a lot of false urgency on myself ‚Äî it‚Äôs something I need to work on. I love the challenge of making an iOS app but <strong>everything in moderation</strong>. I need to have balance and headspace for other more important things in my life.</p>

<p>The best Gameboy is the one you have with you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have been having a blast playing <em>Pok√©mon Crystal</em> (specifically the <a href="https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=373172">Polished Crystal</a> romhack) for the Gameboy Color, <em>Tetris</em>, and <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser‚Äôs Inside Story</em> for the Nintendo DS with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688">Delta for iPhone</a>. At the time of this post Delta <strong>is still #1</strong> in the App Store thanks to Apple‚Äôs sudden and inexplicable<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> change of heart. It‚Äôs an incredible app that‚Äôs been in the works for a <a href="https://github.com/rileytestut/Delta">long time</a> by Riley Testut. You can support it on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/rileyshane">Patreon</a>.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been having fun making a <a href="https://noah978.gitbook.io/delta-docs/skins">custom skin</a> for Gameboy Color to improve the screen size and ergonomics in landscape.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> I‚Äôve been playing with the <a href="https://www.gamesir.hk/products/gamesir-g8-galileo">Gamesir G8 controller</a> ‚Äî which is great.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Pok√©mon is fine with onscreen controls but a real controller is ideal for games like <em>Super Mario World</em> and <em>Tetris</em>.</p>
<p>What makes retro gaming on iPhone so special is everything that makes the iPhone such a compelling product: great support for wireless headphones, great battery life, streaming to your TV with AirPlay, and game controller support. This entire ecosystem was just <em>dying</em> to get emulation added to the mix. Federico and John covered this well on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/macstories-unwind/id1510451759?i=1000653687197">MacStories Unwind</a>.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The past few years I‚Äôve been following along with Russ at <a href="https://retrogamecorps.com/author/onionsaregross/">Retro Game Corp</a> and have bought the <a href="https://retrogamecorps.com/2022/05/15/miyoo-mini-v2-guide/">Miyoo Mini</a>, a <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg353v-rg353vs">couple</a> <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xx-h">Anbernics</a>, and even the <a href="https://www.analogue.co/pocket">Analogue Pocket</a>. I see now that I have a problem but I find comfort in knowing <a href="https://wavelengths.online/posts/on-cheap-handhelds-in-a-world-of-smartphone-emulation">Brendon Bigley</a> (of <a href="https://intothecast.online/"><em>Into the Aether</em></a>) is in the same boat.</p>
<p>While these devices can be great uni-taskers with good physical controls, they all fall short of the iPhone when it comes to screen quality, staying charged, and <strong>convenience</strong>:</p>
<p>While waiting in line for coffee on Sunday I pulled out my iPhone and played a few Pokemon battles (thanks to turbo mode) and caught a Jigglypuff. There‚Äôs <em>no way</em> I would have even thought to bring one of those other devices on this quick neighborhood outing. Combine that with auto-saving when putting the phone to sleep ‚Äî it‚Äôs just so easy to dip in and out.</p>

<p>We watched most Best Picture nominations this year and were deliberately trying to watch more film. TV can be a bit of a drag sometimes. Each episode tends to feel like an <em>appetizer</em> where a movie is a <em>meal</em>.</p>
<p><strong>March</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Midsommar</em> I should not have watched this. I was home alone for the weekend and it freaked me out. This is a disturbing (yet somehow beautiful) movie that left me thinking for days.</li>
<li><em>Napoleon</em> had exciting war scenes, sets, costumes, etc. I‚Äôm glad I watched it. Not a ‚Äúmust see‚Äù but it was entertaining.</li>
<li><em>Dune: Part Two</em> was a masterclass of cinema. We saw this in IMAX and were blown away.</li>
<li><em>Poor Things</em> was odd, delightful, and excellently done. I loved the style and world they created for this film and glad Emma won another Oscar.</li>
<li><em>Wonka</em> (2024) was bad. I expected to learn how Wonka went from a fun-loving chocolate maker to a maniacal recluse. Instead Timoth√©e Chalamet <em>tries</em> being silly as an indentured servant. If 80% of your runtime is about laundry, you know you‚Äôve screwed up. A few nice moments but overall a huge miss. (Also a main character‚Äôs name is Noodle. Noodle!)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>February</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</em> was fine. Good ending to the series I guess. <em>Thor Ragnorok</em> and <em>Guardians 1</em> were lightning-in-a-bottle and their sequels have all been a letdown.</li>
<li><em>Jenny Slate: Seasoned Professional</em> was incredibly funny. This was the first time we had watched her standup. I only knew her from <em>Parks &amp; Rec</em>.</li>
<li><em>Paterson</em> (2016): very random but I was in a hotel room so I had nothing else going on. Dan Benjamin mentioned it in <a href="https://www.backtowork.limo/638"><em>Back to Work 638</em></a> so I gave it a shot. Slow and sleepy but a nice slice of life.</li>
<li><em>Oppenheimer</em> (rewatch). I watched this with my parents (it was their first viewing) and as soon as credits rolled both of them went ‚Äúwoah‚Äù and that‚Äôs when I knew it‚Äôd win Best Picture.</li>
<li><em>American Fiction</em> was excellent. Jeffrey Wright and the whole cast were outstanding.</li>
<li><em>Princess Mononoke</em>: I‚Äôm slowly watching all the Ghibli/Miyazaki movies. This one‚Äôs surprisingly violent! Beautiful animation.</li>
<li><em>Asteroid City</em>: I am a longtime fan of Wes Anderson but this movie just made me angry. Everything about this production is world-class: cast, costume, and designs; but the story had no heart. I felt <em>nothing</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>January</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Anatomy of a Fall</em> was a great mystery. It played with the timeline of events really well. The courtroom scenes, while probably not realistic, were exceptional.</li>
<li><em>May December</em> had terrific performances by Portman and Moore. The ending felt a bit anticlimactic. The ending made us think, ‚Äúwait, that‚Äôs it?‚Äù</li>
<li><em>Maestro</em> is world-class. Bradley did good. The scene where he‚Äôs conducting in the cathedral was incredible. Classical music FTW.</li>
<li><em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em> was outstanding. I read the book a few years ago and thought Marty did a great job adapting it into a riveting story. Like <em>Oppenheimer</em> you‚Äôd have no idea this was 3 hours long, it flew by.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Shift</em> (book 2 of <em>Silo</em> series)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="theater">Theater</h2>
<ul>
<li>We saw <em>Hamilton</em> in Chicago. I listened to the soundtrack a bunch in 2020 and saw the Disney Plus version. My parents and brother went in cold turkey and we all had a blast. Angelica (Lencia Kebede) and King George III (Paul Louis Lessard) were fantastic. It‚Äôs tough comparing to the original cast but those two were standouts.</li>
<li><em>The Witch</em> (Krannert Center for the Performing Arts) was a modern and fun retelling of <em>The Witch</em> from the 1600s.</li>

<p>We said goodbye to our 2015 Subaru Forester (with only 60,000 miles!). We bought a lightly used 2021 RAV4 Prime plug-in hybrid. It feels like the future: so many fancy safety features. The 40 mile all-EV mode is wonderful for daily errands. Then the gas engine is there for long-distance trips. Best of both worlds.

			 <p>My <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@haglund/112135073528546378">initial reaction</a> to hearing about the United States versus Apple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôd boil down the DoJ lawsuit as ‚ÄúApple works hard to ensure their product has good and people like it‚Äù and apparently that is illegal? I totally agree with the App Store complaint. These other things are‚Ä¶ yeesh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later I read <a href="http://manton.micro.blog/2024/03/21/early-thoughts-on.html">Manton Reece‚Äôs thoughts</a>, which more or less aligns with mine. The App Store is an absolute cluster of corrosive incentives for Apple which <del>limits</del> hurts businesses<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and stifles innovation.</p>
<p>Jason Snell has a <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/03/u-s-versus-apple-a-first-reaction/">great piece at Six Colors</a>. In a nutshell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lock-in will be on trial.</strong> Many of the DoJ arguments come down to this: Every feature that Apple builds that makes it harder to switch to an Android phone is fundamentally anticompetitive. ‚Ä¶ the DoJ envisions a competitive smartphone market ‚Ä¶ in which there‚Äôs as little friction as possible when jumping between platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As he mentions, the CarPlay and Apple TV+ arguments are asinine. This part, however, got me worried about what precedent this case could set:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it illegal for Apple to use its power to improve the user experience? What about when it cuts itself in for some sweet Services revenue along the way?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I design for a <a href="https://haglund.app/blog/2024/working-at-john-deere/">big corporation</a> so I‚Äôm part of the <em>Big Scary Tech</em> this bill is targeting (therefore my perspective is biased). As I read more on the topic, my mind keeps wandering back to this doomsday of question: is Design ‚Äî the art of making things with value, with quality, with utility ‚Äî ultimately under attack?</p>
<hr>
<p>While I disagree with some ideas in this lawsuit, I‚Äôm fascinated to see what happens.</p>
<p>Apple could stand to loosen up a bit, without losing much. Let apps run outside the App Store. Let people use the smartwatch of their choice. Let users use their godawful bank as an alternative wallet to Apple Pay. What we‚Äôll all learn together is that the total package, the <em>design</em> of this ecosystem, is what customers pay for and <em>want</em>.</p>
<p>In other words: if Apple has to compete, I‚Äôm confident they‚Äôll win.</p>

			 <p>My UX career started with an internship at <a href="https://www.cazoodle.com">Cazoodle</a> (a now-defunct, as far as I can tell) startup in the University of Illinois Research Park. After a year or so I got the opportunity to intern at the John Deere Innovation Center in Champaign, where I worked on mobile apps and had a blast. I owe a lot to my then (and now) <a href="https://inkypixelsdesign.com/">boss</a> for how my career has unfolded so far.</p>
<p>In 2017 I left John Deere to join a <a href="https://nutrienagsolutions.com/agrible">startup</a> and followed that path for 5 years (a story for another time). I‚Äôve been back at John Deere for about a year-and-a-half and it‚Äôs amazing how a company with such a long history has adapted and modernized in a few short years.</p>
<p>Yesterday a colleague shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I3z-3zAd_Y">corporate video</a> about what it‚Äôs like working at John Deere. I think it rings true and echoes the reasons I returned to the company and love my job. Hopefully I don‚Äôt come off as a corporate shill, but I do sincerely think it‚Äôs a great place to build a career and make an impact.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm incredibly lucky.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/21/24045324/apple-magic-mouse-wireless-charging-lightning-base">Wes Davis at The Verge</a> wrote about accessories that attempt to make the Magic Mouse more ergonomic. I bought <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C7G8V4PC?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">one of these</a> on a whim back in November with the expectation it could address a few issues with Apple‚Äôs Magic Mouse:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increase the bulk of the mouse to help my hand rest more comfortably.</li>
<li>Easier charging thanks to wireless charging.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="comfort">Comfort</h2>
<p>On the whole I would say these accessories do make Magic Mouse more comfortable when mousing around or when resting your hand while reading. You‚Äôll need to remind yourself to let your hand relax more but all-around you do get a more ‚Äúhand-friendly‚Äù object.</p>
<p>Scrolling is where things fall apart. It may shock you to learn that we scroll <em>a lot</em> when using computers. When using two-finger scrolling with Magic Mouse your fingers are pitched and need to move more than a standard scroll-wheel. The shoe doesn‚Äôt make this interaction <em>less</em> comfortable, but it does not improve it. Despite its derisive design, I‚Äôm not sure how Apple could have made two-finger scrolling more comfortable.</p>
<h2 id="wireless-charging">Wireless Charging</h2>
<p>Adding wireless charging to Magic Mouse is nicer than spearing the turtle with a lightning cable. I could quickly attach the mouse to a MagSafe puck when getting up for lunch meaning the battery would always be topped up.</p>
<p>One downside is that is causes a <em>tiny</em> electrical hum when charging. It took me a while to notice it at first but then it was impossible to <em>not</em> notice (see also: the arrow in the FedEx logo).</p>
<p>Another quirk is that you can‚Äôt use Magic Mouse while it‚Äôs charging. The mouse shuts off w because it assumes it‚Äôs upside-down with a cable jutting out. I imagined using a <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/mice-mouse-pads/mouse-pads/rog-balteus-qi-model/">Qi mouse pad</a> for endless battery life but this is not possible.</p>
<p>The last kicker is that I switch between a work and personal MacBook daily which requires removing the boot and pairing directly by Lightning each time I switch computers. I‚Äôd guess most people don‚Äôt have this problem, but I thought I‚Äôd mention it.</p>
<h2 id="verdict">Verdict</h2>
<p>These boots helped me realized the Magic Mouse itself no longer for me. Between poor multi-device support and discomfort, I decided to dig out an <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/m510-wireless-mouse.910-001822.html?crid=7">old Logitech mouse</a> which solves both problems: good ergonomics by default and automatically pairing (its USB-A dongle stays plugged into my Thunderbolt dock).</p>

			 <p>I haven‚Äôt been able to try Apple Vision Pro yet, but the Mac screen-sharing feature reminded me of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10245?time=444">‚ÄúDesign for Spatial Interactions‚Äù</a> session from WWDC 2021. It‚Äôs fascinating that Apple has been using this ‚Äúspatial‚Äù term for a few years now.</p>
<p>Like all Apple Design videos, it‚Äôs excellent. They talk about the precision locating UI for AirTag and the interactions behind handoff for HomePod mini. Putting your iPhone <em>near</em> your HomePod will move audio from iPhone to HomePod. It‚Äôs pretty magical. In both cases they‚Äôre talking about how physical ‚Äî or spatial ‚Äî actions can convey user intent, something traditionally conveyed with taps or buttons.</p>
<p>This is relevant for Vision Pro‚Äôs Mac screen-sharing feature. It‚Äôs triggered by looking at your Mac. There are some other clever features like the autocomplete bar that floats above your physical Bluetooth keyboard but this <em>just look at it</em> gesture seems under-utilized in visionOS 1.0 and could be extended much further.</p>
<p>For example: you‚Äôre watching a movie in Vision Pro and your spouse arrives home. What if you could look at your AirPlay-enabled TV and it could start playback on <em>that</em> screen, letting you share that experience in reality.</p>
<p>Or similarly, say you‚Äôre listening to music on Vision Pro. Look at a HomePod to handoff the audio. (There are <em>dozens</em> of HomePod owners who could benefit from something like this.) Similarly what if the audio seamlessly followed you as you moved from room to room ‚Äî without blasting on every speaker in the house.</p>
<p>Maybe looking at a HomePod could cause a flurry of your favorite albums to flutter above. With a look you could start playing music. Eliminating the need to recall and verbalize a lengthy album title and artist, bringing that familiar feeling of the family record player.</p>
<p>Or would it be possible to use your iPhone‚Äôs keyboard for Vision Pro just by looking at your phone? (This could work similar to the Apple TV input handoff.) The typing experience on visionOS without a physical keyboard is  severely lacking so this could be a game-changer.</p>
<p>(As an extension of this, what if you could AirPlay your iPhone into Vision Pro? This could be a sweet solution for getting offline videos for travel situations if native apps from big players like YouTube and Netflix never show up.)</p>
<p>Or what if someone wants to show you a photo on <em>their</em> phone while you‚Äôre wearing the headset like a sociopath? Maybe they could cast it into <em>your</em> headset to enjoy a beautiful panorama from a recent trip.</p>
<hr>
<p>These are just a few examples that come to mind. I think there is a huge opportunity to rethink how we interact with <em>digital</em> things in a <em>physical</em> way. By all accounts Apple Vision Pro and visionOS are very 1.0 and I‚Äôm excited to see where this takes us over the next decade.</p>

			 <p>The other weekend my wife and I watched the excellent <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em> on Apple TV+. We opted to skip the theatrical and digital purchase windows despite loving <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/193388249-killers-of-the-flower-moon">the book</a> and Apple‚Äôs caginess around when <em>exactly</em> the film would debut on the streaming service.</p>
<p>Right off the bat the movie‚Äôs <a href="https://soundtracks.lnk.to/killersofflower">soundtrack</a> by the <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/listen-to-robbie-robertson-soundtrack-for-new-martin-scorsese-movie-killers-of-the-flower-moon/">late Robbie Robertson</a> set the tone<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and pace. We were hooked. A few minutes in, however, we started noticing blocky pixels ‚Äî the video stream oscillating between vivid 4K and 240p pixelated mush from minute to minute.</p>
<p>It was just how Marty intended.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>I naively thought pausing would give it a chance to buffer and it‚Äôd be smooth sailing. As the stuttering continued I restarted the Apple TV, force quit the TV app, ran a speed test<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and yet the issue persisted. Then the stream <em>completely</em> failed and a panic set upon the room. Life happens pretty fast. You never know the next time you‚Äôll have the time and disposition to watch a three hour movie. <strong>It was now or never.</strong></p>
<p>I wondered if the problem was with <em>streaming</em> the movie so I opened the TV app on my iPhone, found the movie, and hit download. A minute later the download completed and I used AirPlay to put it on the TV. The rest of the movie went without a hitch<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and we enjoyed the riveting and heartbreaking story of the Osage killings.</p>
<hr>
<p>It was less than ideal needing two Apple devices to watch an Apple-produced movie. This is because Apple TV+ in the TV app on the Apple TV hardware does not support <strong>downloading</strong> video. For inexplicable reasons this overpriced hockey puck comes in <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-tv/apple-tv-4k">2 storage tiers</a> but you can‚Äôt actually <em>store</em> anything on it.</p>
<p>That said I can see why Apple might not want to implement this feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike an iPhone you‚Äôre unlikely to take an Apple TV with you on an airplane and need to load up on movies before takeoff.</li>
<li>Then there‚Äôs the messiness of managing and removing downloaded media.</li>
<li>I fear Apple is allergic of buttons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you have a slower than average network at home, intermittent server outages, or taking an Apple TV to a hotel or Airbnb TV with crappy Wi-Fi, there are scenarios that could make this feature worthwhile.</p>
<p>The most straightforward solution is offering a download button on the episode or movie detail view ‚Äî just like on iOS and the Mac. (Maybe a long press on the Play button could expose a menu with this option.)</p>
<p>Another idea is treating download as a <em>fallback</em> to streaming. Maybe the OS could notice streaming quality is low and prompt the user with something like, ‚ÄúDownload movie? This can take a few moments but should play without interruption afterwards.‚Äù Playback could resume from the same spot using the local file and get automatically offloaded 24 hours later.</p>
<p>I know offline downloading is not a glamorous feature but little touches like this could make the Apple TV a bit more forgiving in the real world.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I saw <a href="https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2024/01/the-mac-turns-40/">several</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24048479/apple-mac-40-anniversary">lovely</a> posts celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Mac today. The 30th gave us the wonderful <a href="https://rknightuk.github.io/mac-30-font-svg/">Mac Font</a> and somehow feels like yesterday. A lot has changed in the world and my life since then, but one thing has been a constant:</p>
<p>I‚Äôve always felt at home with the Mac.</p>
<p>I have a scattering of memories with the Mac throughout my life. I recall playing with vintage Macs in the school library in kindergarten or first-grade (circa 1996). I was blown away by the <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/218460/the-exceptional-imac-g4-ten-years-later.html">iMac G4</a> and it‚Äôs the reason I went into design. It showed how products can <em>delight</em>. I spent countless hours after school using my grandma‚Äôs iMac G5 to <del>do homework</del> play games.</p>
<p>But it wasn‚Äôt until I had my own Mac that I fell in love. After a couple summers working for the high school alumni newsletter (produced with G3, G4, and G5 Power Macs) I saved up and bought a 12‚Äù iBook G4. Bonus: it came with a silver iPod mini. I curated a music collection and customized every aspect of it with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031206095326/http://www.panic.com/candybar/">Candybar</a>. After running through multiple (and expensive) power cables and batteries, I made a massive jump to a white Intel MacBook.</p>
<p>I used the hell out of that Mac. I learned Illustrator, Final Cut Pro, Garageband, Photoshop, and so many other tools that let me explore being creative. It was my portal to the internet and chatting with friends on <a href="https://www.adium.im">Adium</a>. It‚Äôs where I amassed an astounding amount of <del>legally obtained</del> music and movies that shaped my taste.</p>
<p>The Mac fits my brain in a way where I can create and work effortlessly. It‚Äôs always had a flourishing community of developers building utilities to extend platform. The flexibility and openness of the Mac is what makes it so special.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> From PowerPC to Intel then Intel to Apple Silicon I‚Äôve seen huge leaps in what Mac are capable of. <em>The Mac Goes On</em> and I‚Äôve enjoyed witnessing the evolution from Tiger to Sonoma.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs to 40 more.</p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">

<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>I want this post to celebrate what I love about the Mac. These points on openness and flexibility highlight my, and governments around the world, frustrations with iOS, iPadOS, and (soon to be) visionOS. These systems are closed off and I think it does a lot more harm than good.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Do not remove a fence unless you know why it was put up in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One example is from <a href="https://steveblank.com/2009/12/21/the-elves-leave-middle-earth-%E2%80%93-soda%E2%80%99s-are-no-longer-free/">Steve Blank‚Äôs <em>The Elves Leave Middle Earth ‚Äì Sodas Are No Longer Free</em></a> about a startup CFO killing free snacks without understanding the knock-on effects. It‚Äôs a great anecdote.</p>
<p>Parrish‚Äôs post concludes (original emphasis):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It reminds us that we don‚Äôt always know better than those who made decisions before us, and we can‚Äôt see all the nuances to a situation until we‚Äôre intimate with it. <strong>Unless we know why someone made a decision, we can‚Äôt safely change it or conclude that they were wrong.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The first step before modifying an aspect of a system is to understand it. Observe it in full. Note how it interconnects with other aspects, including ones that might not be linked to you personally. Learn how it works, and then propose your change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôm sure you can apply this lesson to your life one way or another (otherwise it wouldn‚Äôt be in the <em>Wisdom Project</em>) but it resonated with me as a designer and someone who works in software.</p>
<p>You might have seen a portfolio piece from a UX designer who proclaimed, ‚ÄúI fixed Twitter!‚Äù<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> with a beautiful reimagining of the interface. These projects can be a great way for designers to learn and explore their own taste but please be humble. You don‚Äôt have a full picture of the priorities and constraints the design team was under nor the problem they were asked to solve.</p>
<p>While the expression ‚ÄúChesteron‚Äôs Fence‚Äù was new to me, the idea was not. I received it as advice and it changed my approach when I started my job at Agrible back in 2017. I was the first design lead at the startup and they had been making software for a few years. My instinct was to move fast and make changes but instead I spent my first few weeks listening to the team and learning the product before suggesting any process or design changes.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a skill I try to practice when any new project comes my way. Stay open-minded and don‚Äôt think about your decisions in a vacuum.</p>

		<div class="e-content">

<p>This past week I was lucky enough to visit the renowned John Deere Headquarters in Moline, IL. The buildings were designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eero_Saarinen">Eero Saarinen</a> (known for his work on the St. Louis Arch) and landscaped by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideo_Sasaki">Hideo Sasaki</a>. My timing could not have been better with the weather and I was able to experience the area in all its winter glory.</p>
<p>As you approach you see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Deere_%26_Company_World_Headquarters.jpg">massive structure</a> perched on a hill with a road that winds around a pond. It‚Äôs an impressive sight that makes you think: damn, this must be a big company. (This trip in particular evoked the snowy cliffside temple from Nolan‚Äôs <em>Batman Begins</em>.)</p>
<h1 id="nighttime">Nighttime</h1>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There are several incredibly long hallways to get from the parking lot to the office spaces. Walking throughout the structure gave me <em>Severance</em> vibes, which coincidentally was filmed at another Saarinen creation: <a href="https://bell.works/new-jersey/explore">Bell Works</a>.</p>
<h1 id="garden">Garden</h1>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Aside from its zen garden, pond, modular grid system, and mid-century design, the standout feature, to me, is the atrium filled with plants and basked in sunlight.</p>
<p>Leaving headquarters involves driving slowly through a hilly wooded area. There are moments where you can see the building but by-and-large you‚Äôre enveloped by trees. I couldn‚Äôt help but notice the physical transition going from work to life. You‚Äôre forced to drive through nature and leave behind the corporate edifice. As someone who works fully-remote, there was something nice about that.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm positive the designers intended all these beautiful and inspiring moments. It delivers.</p>

			 <h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
<p>My goal is to collect the stories and art I experienced in 2023 with a sprinkle of personal updates. Reflecting on the year was a fun process and I hope to turn this into an annual tradition.</p>
<h2 id="tech-stories">Tech Stories</h2>
<p>There were a lot of disastrous tech stories this year but <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/23andme-credential-stuffing-data-stolen/">23andMe‚Äôs data breach</a> has a special spot in my heart. When I think about the implications for how this data could be misused (off the dome: planting false evidence at a crime scene, the inevitability of nonconsensual cloning), I have a hard time racking my brain for data that‚Äôs more sensitive. Stories like this <em>should</em> remind us to be more thoughtful of what we put online. Based on what I see on LinkedIn (a ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù network), society has ways to go.</p>
<p>Other stories that spring to mind are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/gm-justifies-decision-to-ditch-apple-carplay-due-to-stability-issues/">GM‚Äôs bone-headed decision to drop CarPlay</a> and the spectacular bungled effort to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23981848/sam-altman-back-open-ai-ceo-microsoft-board">fire Sam Altman</a>. The world came <em>this close</em> to Microsoft hiring every employee from OpenAI.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Speaking of close calls: <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-adobe-abandon-proposed-merger/">Adobe almost acquired Figma</a>. I‚Äôm bummed for the Figma employees (who missed out on a big windfall) but this is probably for the best.</p>
<p>We saw the <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/12/31/elon-musks-x-fidelity-valuation-cut">collapse of Twitter</a>, which was bound to happen, but did anyone think it‚Äôd deteriorate this quickly? In its wake we saw the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/10/23787453/meta-instagram-threads-100-million-users-milestone">meteoric launch of Threads</a> and <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon‚Äôs</a> slow-and-steady growth. I hope smaller services like <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> are getting their day in the sun. In 2024 and beyond I‚Äôm ready for a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-commentary/internet-future-about-to-get-weird-1234938403/">weirder internet</a>.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs for these reasons I‚Äôm starting a blog.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> After years of posting to <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewhaglund">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/andrewhaglund/">Instagram</a>, it‚Äôs time to have a proper home on the web. I‚Äôve settled on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short, frequent posts on <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@haglund">Mastodon</a></li>
<li>Long, infrequent posts here (<a href="/feed/feed.xml">subscribe via RSS</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-year-of-development">The Year of Development</h2>
<p>I prefer <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex/150">Yearly Themes</a> over resolutions and while I didn‚Äôt plan a theme for 2023, reflecting on the past year helped a theme emerge retroactively: <em>the Year of Development</em>.</p>
<p>After the initial excitement of the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/wwdc23-highlights/">Vision Pro unveiling at WWDC</a> I spent many summer nights and weekends learning SwiftUI and SwiftData. In September I launched my first app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833">MapKeep</a>.</p>
<p>I noodled around with an app for Merlin Mann‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom/blob/master/wisdom.md">Wisdom Project</a> and a packing/shopping list app based on Myke Hurley‚Äôs request in <a href="https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/489">Upgrade 489</a>). These projects are on-hold for now.</p>
<p>Weebly hosted my personal site for 10 years but I grew tired of its outdated editor and <em>godawful</em> blogging tools. I used this as an excuse to learn HTML/CSS and rebuilt my site from scratch. At the end of December the site was rebuilt again using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">Eleventy</a>.</p>
<h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>
<p>I visited Des Moines, IA, for a week every quarter for ‚Äúin-person week‚Äù at work. My brother happened to live there which meant we could get dinner downtown or watch an episode of <em>The Sopranos</em> at his apartment. Those days are behind us now that he‚Äôs moved to Chicago. It reminds me to always take advantage of opportunities to see family.</p>
<p>I went to Florida to visit sugar cane growers in February. The area was recovering from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/us/hurricane-ian-fort-myers-beach-florida/index.html">Hurricane Ian</a> and the destruction was awful. Fort Myers Beach was on a boil order. The hotel was underwater days before I checked-in. I spent a few hours walking the beach and marveled at collapsed hotels, restaurants, and homes.</p>
<p>In May we went to Michigan for a high-school friend‚Äôs wedding. A week later we went to a cousin‚Äôs high school graduation in Denver and we hiked at <a href="https://www.jeffco.us/1332/Mount-Falcon-Park">Mount Falcon Park</a>.</p>
<p>As an annual tradition we spent a week with my in-laws in Madison, WI, in June visiting downtown, breweries, and the <a href="https://union.wisc.edu/visit/terrace-at-the-memorial-union/">UW Union Terrace</a>. In August we made a trip to Missouri for our niece‚Äôs 2nd birthday.</p>
<p>At the end of September a close friend and college roommate got married in the Virginia/DC area. We had great time reminiscing over our stupidity in college.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>I continue to work for John Deere as a UX Lead and love it. I was recently promoted and my area of responsibly has grown and I now directly manage a few designers. I‚Äôm adjusting to the new role and I‚Äôll be reading <em><a href="https://hbr.org/books/watkins">The First 90 Days</a></em> ASAP.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm fortunate to have a <a href="https://inkypixelsdesign.com">great mentor and manager</a>. This was a tough year for layoffs across a lot of industries and I don‚Äôt take my position for granted.</p>
<p>I try to stay connected with the University of Illinois and in March I gave a talk about the design process at the <a href="https://designcenter.illinois.edu/">Siebel Center of Design</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="games">Games</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm approaching the end of the main storyline in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> and ‚Ä¶ what a masterpiece. <em>Mario Wonder</em> was a blast! 2023 was <a href="https://intothecast.transistor.fm/episodes/the-2023-game-of-the-year-spectacular">filled with amazing games</a> and I expect my <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/oled">OLED Steam Deck</a> can help expose me to more non-Nintendo games in 2024.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been playing retro games:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Pok√©mon Red</em> (<a href="https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/2362/">Anniversary romhack</a>) and <em>Tetris</em> on my silver <a href="https://www.analogue.co/pocket">Analogue Pocket</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.shipofharkinian.com">PC port</a> of <em>Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> on the Mac.</li>
<li><em>Super Mario World</em>, naturally.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Christmas the <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/covert-dock-2">Genki dock</a> let my cousins and I (ranging from ages 12 to 32) play local co-op with 6-players in <em>Super Smash Bros</em>. Chaotic joy.</p>
<h2 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h2>
<p>I heard the podcast ad market was tough in 2023. Hosts would mention this occasionally and I noticed fewer (or zero) ads. I decided to open <a href="https://bellroy.com/products/card-sleeve-wallet?color=hazelnut&amp;material=leather&amp;size=default">my wallet</a> and financially support the work I love:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://atp.fm/">Accidental Tech Podcast</a></em>: Exceptionally consistent. Gotta support John now that <a href="https://hypercritical.co/2022/03/30/independence-day">he‚Äôs gone indie</a>.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://intothecast.online">Into the Aether</a></em>: I have a tremendous appreciation for the art of video game creation thanks to Brendon and Stephen.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/Roderick/">Roderick on the Line</a></em>: I‚Äôve been listening to the internet‚Äôs Merlin Mann and the Long Winters‚Äô John Roderick for a <em>long time</em>.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.relay.fm/upgrade">Upgrade</a></em>: Myke and Jason‚Äôs segments on Apple and the entertainment industry keep me coming back week after week.</li>
</ul>
<p>I loved <a href="https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/mccartney-a-life-in-lyrics">Sir McCartney‚Äôs show</a> where he tells the stories behind his killer songs.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2024 I want to reduce my podcast intake or introduce more variety. It‚Äôs too easy for me to pop-in an AirPod and tune-out the world. I‚Äôm not giving myself enough time for silence.</p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>Thanks to Apple Music‚Äôs awkward <a href="https://replay.music.apple.com/">Replay</a> feature I have a list of most-listened music from 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://boygenius.lnk.to/therecord">the record</a></em> by boygenius</li>
<li><em><a href="https://oliviarodrigo.lnk.to/GUTS">GUTS</a></em> by Olivia Rodrigo</li>
<li><em><a href="https://m83.lnk.to/fantasy">Fantasy</a></em> by M83</li>
<li><em><a href="https://af.lnk.to/_WEAW">WE</a></em> by Arcade Fire (2022)</li>
<li><em><a href="https://interscope.lnk.to/Multitudes">Multitudes</a></em> by Feist</li>
<li><em><a href="https://death-cab-for-cutie.lnk.to/AMAcoustic">Asphalt Meadows (Acoustic)</a></em> by Death Cab for Cutie</li>
<li><em><a href="https://mitski.lnk.to/TLIIASAW">The Land Is Hospitable and So Are We</a></em> by Mitski</li>
<li><em><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/oppenheimer-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1697599270">Oppenheimer</a></em> by Ludwig G√∂ransson</li>
<li><em><a href="https://daftpunk.lnk.to/RAM_Originals">Random Access Memories</a></em> by Daft Punk (2013) is routinely played on Friday afternoons as work winds down. (I will <strong>not</strong> link to the drumless abomination.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other music highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>I started digging into Peter Gabriel‚Äôs <em><a href="https://lnk.to/PG21">i/o</a></em>. There are 3 mixes of the album which is fascinating. I can‚Äôt explain it but the acoustic guitar in the opening track <em>Panopticom</em> fills me with joy.</li>
<li>Sufjan Stevens‚Äô <em><a href="https://sufjanstevens.lnk.to/javelin">Javelin</a></em> was lovely but I haven‚Äôt listened to it enough.</li>
<li>I recorded a short composition called <a href="https://soundcloud.com/andrewhaglund/a-quiet-night"><em>A Quiet Night</em></a>.</li>
<li>As part of a Christmas gift I introduced my brother to some chords on the guitar.</li>
<li>My hopes are high for Michael Stipe‚Äôs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/03/magazine/michael-stipe-solo-album.html">first post-R.E.M. album</a> (I first heard it teased on <a href="https://www.smartless.com/episodes/episode/24585bee/michael-stipe">Smartless</a>). The <a href="https://found.ee/rem-up25"><em>Up</em> remaster</a> was impeccable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Live shows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rodgab.com">Rodrigo y Gabriela</a> at Krannert‚Äôs <a href="https://krannertcenter.com/ellnora">Ellnora</a> festival. They‚Äôre gods. (Thanks to Se√±ora Kooy, my high school Spanish teacher, who originally introduced me to this duo.)</li>
<li><a href="https://laurenmayberry.co.uk">Lauren Mayberry</a> of Churches at the Rose Bowl. I missed seeing her opener, <a href="https://toastmp3.bandcamp.com/album/supermodels">Claud</a> whose record is a gift to humanity.</li>
<li>YouTube concerts don‚Äôt count but my brother was at a very similar show to <a href="https://youtu.be/TolZh65YsmM?si=mGJnauI28TmKEXYv">Bon Iver at Pitchfork</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>One last note: we all heard a new Beatles song this year. Its authenticity is contentious but seeing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzcsKb8iLY&amp;pp=ygUZbm93IGFuZCB0aGVuIGNlbnRyYWwgcGFyaw%3D%3D">people singing <em>Now and Then</em> in Central Park</a> is something. It‚Äôs hard to imagine this song hasn‚Äôt been around for 50 years.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>I started supporting <a href="https://kottke.org">kottke.org</a> by becoming a <a href="https://kottke.org/members">member</a>. His site is an invaluable source of information on the internet across a variety of topics and help satiates my curiosity.</p>
<p>I read <em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/310896/expecting-better-by-emily-oster/">Expecting Better</a></em> which is the <em>Freakonomics</em> of pregnancy.</p>
<p>30 seconds into Apple‚Äôs trailer for <a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2023/06/apple-tv-renews-hit-world-building-drama-silo-for-season-two/"><em>Silo</em></a> and I was hooked. Before the show aired I read the first book, <em><a href="https://hughhowey.com/books/wool/">Wool</a></em>. I‚Äôm currently reading <em><a href="https://hughhowey.com/books/shift/">Shift</a></em>, book 2 of 3. If you‚Äôre a fan of the show, read the books.</p>
<p>(I <em>think</em> I read more than this but I don‚Äôt have a good tracking system.)</p>
